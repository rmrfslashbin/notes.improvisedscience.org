# Ingredients

-   2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling (optional)
-   113 grams (4 ounces) pancetta or bacon, diced
-   1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced
-   1 small or medium fennel bulb (about 6 ounces), tough outer leaves
    and stems discarded and thinly sliced crosswise
-   1 tablespoon roughly chopped fennel fronds
-   2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
-   2 teaspoons fennel seeds
-   ½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)
-   Kosher salt and black pepper
-   1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes with their juices, tomatoes
    crushed by hand
-   1 pound jumbo shrimp, preferably wild, peeled and deveined
-   1 (15-ounce) can white beans, such as butter beans or cannellini
    beans, drained and rinsed
-   ½ cup roughly chopped fresh herbs, such as Italian parsley, basil,
    mint or a combination (optional)

# Preparation

-   In a deep 12-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over medium. Add the
    pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to crisp,
    **4 to 5 minutes**. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a
    paper towel-lined plate.
-   Add the **onion** and **sliced fennel** to the skillet and cook
    until **softened, 3 to 4 minutes**.
-   Stir in the **garlic**, **fennel seeds** and **red-pepper flakes**,
    if using, and cook until the garlic begins to soften and the fennel
    seeds become aromatic, about **1 minute**.
-   Season with **salt and pepper**.
-   Stir in the **crushed tomatoes and their juices**.
-   Fill the tomato can halfway with **water**, swish it around and add
    that, too.
-   Bring the mixture to a **simmer** and cook on **medium-low**,
    allowing the flavors to come together, about **15 minutes**.
-   Turn heat back to **medium**, stir in the **shrimp** and cook until
    just pink, **2 to 3 minutes**.
-   Add the **beans and the cooked pancetta** and cook until warmed
    through, about **2 minutes**.
-   Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary.
-   Divide among bowls, top with the **herbs** and drizzle with a bit
    more **olive oil**, if desired.
