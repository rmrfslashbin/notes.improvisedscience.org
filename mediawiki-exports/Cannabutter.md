Making your own cannabutter (cannabis-infused butter) is quite simple.
After making the cannabutter, you should be able to substitute equal
parts cannabutter for butter. Take caution in dosing- you may want to
blend non-infused butter with infused butter to calibrate the desired
dose. **YMMV**.

# Method

This method simplifies the task of maintaining a consistent temperature
during the infusion process. Other methods indicate infusion on the
stovetop, however, ensuring the butter/cannabis mixture stays within a
range of 150째F to 200째F tends to be difficult. Refrigerate unused
cannabutter in an airtight container.
