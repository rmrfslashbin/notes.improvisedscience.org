## Ingredients

### Filling

-   910 grams fresh spinach, washed, dried, trimmed, and coarsely
    chopped
-   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   85 grams scallions- white and light-green parts only, trimmed and
    finely chopped
-   283 grams crumbled feta cheese
-   65 grams finely grated Greek kefalotyri cheese
-   2 large eggs, lightly beaten
-   30 grams finely chopped fresh dill
-   15 grams finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
-   ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
-   ½ teaspoon sea salt

### Assembly

-   Eighteen 9x14-inch sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed and at room
    temperature
-   1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil for brushing; more as needed
-   2 teaspoons milk

## Preparation

### Wilt the Spinach

-   Heat a 10-inch straight-sided saute pan over medium-high heat.
-   Add a few large handfuls of the spinach and cook, tossing gently
    with tongs.
-   As the spinach starts to wilt, add the rest a few handfuls at a
    time.
-   Cook until all the spinach is wilted and bright green, about 4
    minutes.
-   With a slotted spoon, transfer the spinach to a colander set in a
    sink.
-   Let cool slightly and squeeze with your hands to extract as much of
    the remaining liquid as you can.

### Finish the Filling

-   Wipe the pan dry with a paper towel.
-   Heat the oil in the pan over medium heat.
-   Add the scallions and cook until soft and fragrant, about 4 minutes.
-   Stir in the spinach, turn off the heat, and let cool for 5 minutes.
-   Stir in and mix thoroughly:
    -   Cheeses
    -   Eggs
    -   Dill
    -   Parsley
    -   Nutmeg
    -   Salt

## Assemble the Pie

### Initial Layer

-   With a pastry brush, lightly coat the bottom and sides of a
    9x13x2-inch baking pan with some of the oil.
-   Working quickly, lightly oil one side of a phyllo sheet and lay it
    in the pan oiled side up and off center so that it partially covers
    the bottom and reaches halfway up one long side of the pan (the edge
    on the bottom of the pan will be about 1 inch from the side).
-   Lightly oil the top of another phyllo sheet and lay it oiled side up
    and off center so it reaches halfway up the other long side of the
    pan. (If your pan has sloped sides, the sheets may be slightly
    longer than the bottom of the pan; if so, let the excess go up one
    short side of the pan and then alternate with subsequent sheets.)
-   Repeat this pattern with 4 more phyllo sheets.

### Build Base, Add Filling

-   Next, lightly oil the tops of 3 phyllo sheets and layer them oiled
    side up and centered in the pan.
-   Spread the filling evenly over the last layer.

### Top Layer

-   Repeat the oiling and layering of the remaining 9 phyllo sheets over
    the filling in the same way you layered the previous 9.
-   With the oiled bristles of the pastry brush, push the edges of the
    phyllo down around the sides of the pan to enclose the filling
    completely.

### Score

-   With a sharp knife, score the top phyllo layer into 24 rectangles,
    being careful not to cut all the way through to the filling.
-   Using the same pastry brush, brush the milk along all the score
    marks (this will keep the phyllo from flaking up along the edges of
    the squares).

## Bake

-   Bake the spanakopita until the top crust is golden brown, 35 to 45
    minutes.
-   Let cool until just warm.
-   Cut out the rectangles carefully along the score marks and serve.
