# Ingredients

-   4 6-ounce skinned salmon fillets
-   Salt and black pepper
-   1 tablespoon coriander seeds or ground coriander
-   ¼ teaspoon whole or ground cloves
-   1 ½ teaspoons cumin seed or ground cumin
-   1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
-   2 tablespoons peanut oil, grape seed or other neutral oil, or
    clarified butter

# Preparation

-   Season fillets on both sides with salt and pepper.
-   Toast spices then grind them to a coarse powder in a coffee or spice
    grinder.
-   Press some of the mixture onto the top of each fillet.
-   Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 2 or 3
    minutes.
-   Add the oil or butter and, when it shimmers, place the fillets,
    coated side down, in the pan.
-   Cook about 2 to 3 minutes, or until the spice mixture forms a nicely
    browned crust.
-   Turn the fillets and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the
    salmon just slightly resists when pierced with a thin-bladed knife.
