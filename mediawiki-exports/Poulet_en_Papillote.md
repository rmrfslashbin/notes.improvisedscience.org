## Equipment

-   Heavy baking sheet
-   Parchment Paper

## Preheat Oven

-   Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.

## Ingredients

-   4 free-range, organic, boneless, skinless chicken breasts
-   8 sprigs of fresh thyme, washed (you can also use rosemary,
    tarragon, marjoram, savory, etc., it's totally up to you)
-   4 shallots or two small onions, sliced
-   Juice of one lemon
-   2-3 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
-   2 tsps white wine or marsala
-   2 tsps pale ale honey mustard by Sierra Nevada (this is truly
    delicious stuff)
-   2 Tbsps olive oil plus a little extra for drizzling
-   Sea salt
-   Freshly ground black pepper

## Preparation

### Liquid Mixture

-   Combine together:
    -   White wine
    -   Mustard
    -   Olive Oil

### Prepare Packets

-   Rinse the chicken breasts and pat dry.
-   Mix the olive oil with the mustard, garlic, lemon juice, wine, and
    some salt and pepper.
-   On a heavy baking sheet, lay out 4 sheets of parchment paper roughly
    10 inches square.
-   Fold each sheet in half, making a crease to make sure that the fold
    sticks.
-   Spoon a little of the oil/mustard/garlic mixture onto one half of
    each square of parchment paper (place it where you'll be putting the
    chicken breast).
-   Scatter the sliced shallot or onion over it to create a flavorful
    bed for the chicken breast.
-   Place each chicken breast on one half of the parchment squares and
    spoon the mixture equally over each breast.
-   Top each breast with two thyme sprigs and drizzle a little more
    olive oil over top.
-   Fold the parchment paper over and crimp the three sides together to
    make a neat pocket that will keep all the juices in while cooking.
    It can be a little challenging to get these closed up tight but keep
    working at it (you can crimp the sides if that helps) to make sure
    you've got a good seal as you want the chicken breasts to steam in
    these little pouches.

### Bake

-   Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes.
-   Remove, open the pouches and serve!
