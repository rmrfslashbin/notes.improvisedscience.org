# Preparation

## Prep Pans

-   Grease the insides of two 8-inch loaf pans with butter
-   Line with parchment paper; butter the paper
-   Dust with flour

## Brown Butter

-   In a large skillet, melt **butter** over medium-high heat.
-   Reduce heat to medium and cook until the frothy white milk solids
    sink to the bottom of the pan and turn a fragrant, nutty brown, **5
    to 7 minutes**.
-   Brown butter can burn quickly, so watch it carefully.
-   Brown butter is almost ready when the frantic sound of bubbling
    begins to die down.

## Liquids

-   In a glass liquid measuring cup, combine **bourbon** and
    **vanilla**.
-   Add additional **bourbon** until you reach the 2/3 cup mark.
-   In a large bowl, whisk together bourbon mixture, **pumpkin purée**,
    **eggs** and **applesauce**.
-   With a spatula, scrape all the brown butter from the skillet into
    the pumpkin mixture and stir to combine.

## Drys

-   In another large bowl, whisk together:
    -   all-purpose flour
    -   whole wheat flour
    -   brown sugar
    -   baking soda
    -   salt
    -   cinnamon
    -   ginger
    -   cardamom

## Combine

-   Pour liquid ingredients into dry ingredients and stir to combine.

## Bake

-   Divide batter between the two greased loaf pans. Use a scale to
    ensure equal amounts are in both pans.
-   Place them on a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to oven.
-   Bake for **50 to 60 minutes** or until a tester or toothpick
    inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.
-   Allow bread to cool completely before removing from pan.
