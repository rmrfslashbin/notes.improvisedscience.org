# Ingredients

-   4 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
-   4 bay leaves
-   2 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
-   ½ teaspoons ground allspice
-   1 tablespoon salt
-   ¼ teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon ground black Pepper
-   1 cup brown lentils, rinsed and drained

-   1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil

# Preparation

## Water and Spices

-   In a large Dutch oven over **medium-high**, combine:
    -   5 cups water
    -   garlic
    -   bay leaves
    -   cumin
    -   allspice
    -   salt
    -   pepper

## Add Lentils

-   Bring to a boil, then add **lentils**.
-   Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally and
    adjusting heat to maintain a **simmer** until lentils are softened
    but still quite firm at the center- about **10 minutes**.

## Add Rice

-   Stir in rice, return to a **simmer**.
-   Cover, reduce heat to **medium-low** and cook until the liquid is
    absorbed and the lentils and rice are tender- about **25 minutes**.

## Meanwhile, cook onions

-   In a 12" skillet, heat **oil** until shimmering.
-   Add **onions** and cook, stirring occasionally at first and then
    more frequently once browning begins, until the onions are deeply
    caramelized and crisped- about **10 to 15 minutes**.
-   Using a slotted spoon, transfer the onions to a paper-towel-lined
    plate, spread thin and evenly.
-   Sprinkle with **¼ teaspoon salt** and set aside.

## Finish

-   Once the lentils and rice are tender, remove from heat, uncover, lay
    a kitchen towel over the pot, and place the cover over the towel for
    **10 minutes**.
-   Remove cover and towel, fluff with a fork.
-   Discard bay leaves.
-   Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.
-   Stir in half the **scallions**.
-   Transfer to a serving bowl.
-   Top with the **onions** and remaining **scallions**.
-   Serve.
