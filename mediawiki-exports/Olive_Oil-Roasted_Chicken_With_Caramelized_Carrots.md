# Special Equipment

-   5.5 Quart Dutch Oven

# Preheat Oven

Preheat oven to 325°F.

# Ingredients

-   2 pounds whole chicken legs
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   1 bunch small, thin carrots, preferably with their green tops
-   2 heads garlic, left unpeeled and halved crosswise to expose the
    cloves
-   1 lemon, thinly sliced, seeds removed
-   ½ bunch oregano, plus more leaves for garnish
-   1 cup olive oil

# Preparation

-   Season chicken with salt and pepper.
-   If the carrots have their green tops, trim the tops so that the
    stems are about 1/2- to 1-inch long.
-   Arrange chicken in a large shallow baking dish or shallow braising
    pot so that the legs are snug and lying flat
-   Scatter the garlic head halves, carrots, lemon slices, and oregano
    sprigs among the chicken pieces, nestling everything in there.
-   Pour the olive oil over the chicken and vegetables.
-   Season again with salt and pepper.
-   Place in the oven, uncovered, and roast until the chicken is so
    tender it nearly falls off the bone and the carrots and lemons are
    nicely caramelized, **55 to 65 minutes**.
-   Remove from oven and let cool slightly.
-   Divide chicken, vegetables and lemons among plates (or serve
    straight from the dish it was cooked in) and scatter with carrot
    tops, if you have them, and more oregano before eating.
