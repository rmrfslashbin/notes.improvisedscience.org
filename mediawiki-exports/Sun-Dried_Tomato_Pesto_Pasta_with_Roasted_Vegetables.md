## Preparation

### Roast the Vegetables

-   Line a half-sheet baking pan with parchment paper.
-   In a large bowel, whisk together olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
-   Add to oil and combine:
    -   Diced zucchini
    -   Diced yellow squash
    -   Diced bell pepper
    -   Diced onion
    -   Salt
    -   Pepper
-   On the parchment lined baking sheet, arrange the vegetables in a
    single layer.
-   Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway, until they are
    cooked through and golden.

### Pesto

-   Toast the almonds in a small skillet over medium-low heat, stirring
    frequently, until fragrant and starting to turn golden on the edges,
    about 4 minutes.
-   In the bowl of a food processor, combine:
    -   Sun-dried tomatoes and their oil
    -   Basil
    -   Toasted almonds
    -   Garlic
    -   Lemon juice
    -   Salt
    -   Pinch of red pepper flakes.

Blend, scraping down the sides as necessary, until the contents are
mixed together and roughly uniform.

-   Drizzle in the olive oil while running the machine and blend until
    you’ve reached a relatively smooth, pesto-like consistency.
-   If desired, stir Parmesan cheese into pesto.
-   Taste and stir in additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

### Pasta

-   Bring a large post of salted water to boil.
-   Cook pasta until al dente, according to package directions.
-   Before draining, reserve about 1 cup pasta cooking water.
-   Transfer the cooked pasta to a large serving bowl.

### Combine

-   Pour the pesto into the warm pasta and drizzle in ¼ cup reserved
    cooking water.
-   Toss to combine, adding more cooking water to thin as necessary.
-   Toss in the roasted vegetables.
-   Sprinkle with some chopped fresh basil and serve.
