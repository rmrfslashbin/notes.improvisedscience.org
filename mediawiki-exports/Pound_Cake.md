    paper.

# Ingredients

-   3 large eggs, room temperature
-   3 tablespoons milk, room temperature (high-alt: add 1/2 tbsp milk)
-   1 ½ teaspoons pure vanilla extract
-   150 grams (1 ½ cups) sifted cake flour (130 grams AP flour + 20
    grams corn starch)
-   1 teaspoon baking powder (high-alt: reduce by 1/8 tsp)
-   1 gram (1 ½ teaspoon) salt
-   150 grams (¾ cup) granulated white sugar (high-alt: reduce by 3/4 to
    1 tbsp)
-   185 grams (13 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature
    (high-alt: add 28 grams / 2 tbsp)

# Preparation

## Liquids

In a medium bowl lightly combine:

-   eggs
-   milk
-   vanilla extract

## Drys

In the bowl of your electric mixer (or with a hand mixer), combine the
**dry ingredients** and mix on low speed for about **30 seconds** or
until blended.

-   flour
-   baking powder
-   salt
-   sugar

## Combine

-   Add the **butter** and **half** of the **egg mixture**.
-   Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened.
-   Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for about one minute to
    aerate and develop the cake's structure.
-   Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
-   Gradually add the remaining **egg mixture**, in 2 additions, beating
    about 30 seconds after each addition to incorporate the egg and
    strengthen the cake's structure.

## Into the Pan

Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with an
offset spatula or the back of a spoon.

# Bake

-   Bake for about **55 to 65 minutes** (high-alt: check at 45 mins) or
    until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the
    center comes out clean.
-   If you find the cake browning too much as it bakes, cover with a
    piece of lightly buttered aluminum foil after about 30 minutes.

# Cool

-   Remove the cake from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for
    about 10 minutes.
-   Remove the cake from the pan and cool completely on a lightly
    buttered wire rack.

# Keep

-   The cake will keep, well wrapped, several days at room temperature,
    about one week when refrigerated, or it can be frozen for two
    months.
