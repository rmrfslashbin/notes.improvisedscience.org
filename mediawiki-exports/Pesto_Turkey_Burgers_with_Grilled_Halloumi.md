## Ingredients

-   1 ½ pound ground turkey
-   1/3 cup prepared basil pesto
-   1 sweet onion, peeled, ends trimmed and cut into 4 thick slices
-   6 ounces halloumi cheese, cut into 4 slices
-   4 hamburger buns

## Preparation

### Burgers

-   In a large bowl, combine turkey and pesto.
-   Form the mixture into 4 patties, each about ¾-inch thick.
-   Thread onion slices onto metal skewers; this will help them stay
    together for ease of flipping.

### Grill

-   Prepare a grill for medium heat cooking.
-   Grill burgers and onions until browned and cooked through, about 4
    to 5 minutes per side.
-   Grill halloumi slices until they are browned and just softened, 2 to
    3 minutes per side.
-   Place burgers in buns and top each with a slice of halloumi and some
    onions.
