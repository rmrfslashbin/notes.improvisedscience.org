# Narrative

Since roasting pork tenderloin on a baking sheet gives it little
opportunity to brown, we brush the meat with dark, intense hoisin sauce
to add color and flavor. The spice notes of garlic, anise, and chiles
meld with the pork as it cooks, and the sauce gives the vegetables a
subtle, almost unidentifiable sweetness. We pair the lean tenderloin
with equally quick-cooking fingerling potatoes and green beans. To give
the green beans a chance to steam, we lay the pork over them (which also
insulates the pork and slows down the cooking) along the cooler center
of the baking sheet. Roasting the potatoes cut-side down on the ends of
the sheet develops perfectly browned edges. An easy garlic-chive butter
melts over the resting pork and adds richness to the vegetables.

# Serving Size

-   Serves 4 to 6 people

# Notes

Buy tenderloins that are of equal size and weight so they cook at the
same rate. A rasp-style grater makes quick work of turning the garlic
into a paste. Our favorite hoisin sauce is Kikkoman’s.
