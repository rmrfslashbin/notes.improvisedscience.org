This is a super simple and forgiving spelt bread recipe. With the use of
a stand mixer, it requires little to no kneading, is easy to make and
clean up, and requires maybe 20 minutes of actual work time. All in, the
recipe produces one standard 9" loaf in about 3 hours.

# Special Equipment

-   Stand mixer with a dough hook
-   Warm place for proofing (like an oven with a a "proof" mode)
-   Plastic wrap or towel to cover rising dough
-   Large bowl for rising dough

# Ingredients

-   500g white spelt flour
-   10g fast-action dried yeast
-   7g fine sea salt
-   30 ml tbsp light olive oil (plus extra for bowl)
-   15 ml (21g) honey
-   about 300ml lukewarm water

## Cinnamon/Raisins

To convert this recipe to a cinnamon and raisin loaf, add:

-   3 grams ground cinnamon
-   10 green cardamom pods
-   1/2 cup raisins
-   4 tablespoons butter
-   1/4 cup packed brown sugar
-   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

# Method

## Dry Ingredients

Into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine on
low speed:

-   flour
-   yeast
-   salt
    -   Cinnamon/raisin: add 3 grams ground cinnamon.

Make a well in the center, if not already created.

## Wet Ingredients

In a small bowl, whisk together:

-   olive oil
-   honey
-   warm water

## Combine and First Knead

Add liquid to dry ingredients and knead on medium speed for **5 to 10
minutes** until dough is elastic and moves freely in the bowl. Add extra
water and olive oil if dry ingredients do not incorporate fully. The
hydration of this dough is a but subjective depending on the flour,
humidity, and personal preference.

## First Rise

Place dough into a large oiled bowl. Cover and let stand in a warm place
(24 to 27°C or 75 to 80°F) for **one to three hours** or until **doubled
in size**.

## Second Knead and Shape

-   Punch dough and knead lightly by hand for one minute.
-   If baking in a loaf pan, oil the sides of the pan. Place dough into
    pan.
-   If not baking in a loaf pan, form dough into desired shape.

## Cinnamon/Raisin

-   Roll dough into rectangle wide enough to accommodate loaf pan.
-   Combine brown sugar, ground cardamom seeds, flour, a little more
    cinnamon.
-   Sprinkle sugar mixture evenly over dough.
-   Melt butter and distribution evenly over sugar mixture.
-   Roll dough and place into loaf pan.

## Second Rise

-   Cover and let rise another **one hour** or until **doubled in
    size**.

## Bake

-   If proofing dough in oven, remove dough.
-   Heat oven to **205°C** or **400°F**.
-   With a very sharp knife, make a slash in the top of the dough to
    allow for expansion. (Skip this stop for cinnamon/raisin)
-   Return the dough to hot oven.
-   Dump a cup of cold water into the over to create a blast of steam
    and immediately close oven door.
-   Bake for **15 minutes**, rotate loaf and bake another **15
    minutes**.
-   Bread is done when internal temperate measures **190°F**.
-   Immediately turn out loaf onto wire rack and let cool before
    slicing.

## Cool

-   Remove loaf from oven and let cool **10 minutes**.
-   Turn out loaf onto wire cooling rack and let rest until cool.
