## Serving Size

-   Serves 6 to 8

## Notes

-   Parsnips wider than 1 inch may have tough, fibrous cores that are
    best trimmed and discarded.
-   Using warm water helps the sugar to dissolve more readily.
-   Any combination of carrots and parsnips with a combined weight of 3
    pounds can be used in this recipe.
