-   Food Processor
-   Large Skillet

## Preheat Oven

-   Preheat the oven to 425°F

## Ingredients

-   1 onion, quartered
-   4 garlic cloves
-   1 large carrot, quartered
-   1 celery stalk, quartered
-   2 ½ cups baby spinach
-   1 egg, lightly beaten, or 1 tablespoon chia seeds soaked in 1/4 cup
    water for 15 minutes
-   1 ½ pound lean ground meat (turkey or chicken)
-   1 ¼ cup quinoa, cooked then cooled
-   3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
-   ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
-   ¼ cup ketchup or barbecue sauce

## Preparation

### Skillet

-   Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper.
-   Place onion and garlic in a food processor and pulse until finely
    chopped.
-   Transfer to a large skillet.
-   Add carrot and celery to the food processor, and pulse until
    chopped.
-   Add spinach and pulse a few times more.
-   Add to the skillet.
-   Place the skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring until
    vegetables release liquid.
-   Continue cooking until liquid evaporates and vegetables begin to
    brown, about 8 minutes; add water a tablespoon at a time, if
    necessary, to keep vegetables from sticking.

### Mix

-   Transfer to a large bowl.
-   Add egg, ground meat, quinoa, soy sauce and black pepper to the
    bowl, and mix gently with your hands.
-   Scrape mixture onto the baking sheet and form into a loaf
    approximately 4 inches wide and 10 inches long; wet your hands if
    the mixture is very sticky.
-   Spread top of loaf with ketchup or barbecue sauce.

### Bake

-   Bake until cooked through and browned, about 40 minutes.
-   Cool 5 minutes before slicing.
