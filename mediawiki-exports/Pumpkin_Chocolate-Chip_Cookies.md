These cookies are sourced from the New York Times, modified to give some
extra pumpkin flavor and to cut down the sugar. After baking, the
cookies are very soft and delicate with the consistency of fresh cake.
Gently place the cookies on a rack to cool. As they cool, the cookies
will become more firm and feel more like a traditional cookie.

-   256 grams all-purpose flour
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   1 teaspoon kosher salt
-   2 teaspoons cinnamon
-   ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
-   ¼ teaspoon allspice
-   113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), soft but cool

-   125 grams light brown sugar, packed
-   50 grams granulated sugar
-   300 grams pumpkin purée
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   303 grams chocolate chips

# Preparation

-   Heat oven to 350°F, and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
-   In a medium bowl, stir until well combined:
    -   flour
    -   baking soda
    -   salt
    -   spices
-   In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
    combine:
    -   butter
    -   cream cheese
    -   brown sugar
    -   granulated sugar.
-   Beat on **medium-high** until light and fluffy, about **1 minute**.
-   Add the **pumpkin purée** and **vanilla extract**, and mix to
    combine.
-   Turn the mixer to low, and add the **dry ingredients**.
-   Mix until a few streaks of flour remain.
-   Remove the bowl from the mixer, add the **chocolate chips** and use
    a rubber spatula to fold the mixture until well combined.
-   Scoop the cookies onto prepared baking sheets using roughly 2
    tablespoons, **2 inches apart**.
-   Gently press the cookies with your fingertips to flatten them
    slightly.
-   The batter is quite sticky, so you may occasionally have to rinse
    the cookie scoop and your fingers during this process.
-   Put the cookies in the oven, and bake, until they are **slightly
    cracked** on the surface and golden, and **rotating** the pans from
    top to bottom and front to back halfway through, **12 to 15
    minutes**.
