Rye, cranberries (or cherries), chocolate. Yum! The original recipe
instructs to refrigerate overnight. The cookies seem to be fine without
the chill. After many batches, tart cherries (rather than cranberries)
is the winner.

# Preparation

## Dry Ingredients

Whisk together and set aside:

-   Rye flour
-   All-purpose flour
-   Baking powder
-   Sea salt
-   Baking soda

## Cream Butter & Sugar

-   Working with a stand mixer (fitted with the paddle attachment), beat
    the **butter** and **both sugars** together on **medium** speed for
    **3 minutes**, until blended; scrape the bowl as needed.
-   Add the **egg**, and beat **2 minutes** more.

## Combine

-   Turn off the mixer, add the **dry ingredients** all at once, then
    pulse the mixer a few times to begin blending the ingredients.
-   Beat on low speed until the flour almost disappears.
-   Mix just until incorporated:
-   Poppy seeds
-   Cranberries
-   Chocolate

Scrape the bowl to bring the dough together.

## Roll and Refrigerate

With a lined baking sheet lined with parchment:

-   Divide the dough into **15 pieces**.
-   Roll each piece into a ball between your palms and place on the
    baking sheet.

Cover, and refrigerate the dough overnight or for up to 3 days.

# Pre-bake

-   Center a rack in the oven, and heat it to **425° F**.
-   Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
-   Arrange the cookies on the sheet, leaving 2 inches between each
    cookie (work with half a batch at a time and keep the remaining
    balls of dough in the refrigerator until needed).
-   Sprinkle each cookie with a little flake salt, crushing it between
    your fingers as you do.

# Bake

-   Bake the cookies for **10 minutes**.
-   Pull the baking sheet from the oven and, using a metal spatula, a
    pancake turner or the bottom of a glass, tap each cookie lightly.
-   Let the cookies rest on the sheet for **3 minutes**, then carefully
    transfer them to a rack.
-   Repeat with the remaining dough, always using cold dough and a cool
    baking sheet.

# Serve

Serve after the cookies have cooled for about **10 minutes**, or wait
until they reach room temperature.
