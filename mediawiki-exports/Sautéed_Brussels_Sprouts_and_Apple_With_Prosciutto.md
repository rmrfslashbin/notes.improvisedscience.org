# Equipment

-   12" skillet

# Change Log

-   The original recipe called to freeze and then use a box grater to
    process the prosciutto; I found this to be unnecessary.

# Ingredients

-   57 grams (2 ounces) thinly sliced prosciutto
-   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   2 large Golden Delicious apples, cored and cut into ¼-inch cubes
-   1 ½ pounds brussels sprouts, trimmed and very thinly sliced
-   ¾ teaspoon salt, more as needed
-   ¾ teaspoon black pepper, as needed

# Preparation

-   Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until lightly
    smoking.
-   Add apples and cook, barely moving, until lightly colored, about 5
    minutes.
-   Stir in brussels sprouts and continue cooking, stirring
    occasionally, until tender and golden, 3 to 4 minutes.
-   Season with salt and pepper.
-   Finely chop prosciutto; crumble atop sprouts.
