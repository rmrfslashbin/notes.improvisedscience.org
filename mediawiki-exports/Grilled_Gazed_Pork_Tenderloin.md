## Special Equipment

-   Grill
-   Large container in which to brine tenderloins
-   Five 14-inch lengths of kitchen twine; oiled

## Ingredients

-   2 (1-pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed
-   3 tablespoons Salt
-   1 ½ quarts cold water

### Glaze

-   1 teaspoon vegetable oil
-   3 garlic cloves, minced
-   1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
-   ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
-   ½ cup hoisin sauce (one 210 gram jar)
-   2 tablespoons soy sauce
-   1 tablespoon rice vinegar

## Preparation

### Brine Tenderloin

-   Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt in 1 ½ quarts cold water in large
    container.
-   Lay tenderloins on cutting board, flat side (side opposite where
    silverskin was) up. Holding thick end of 1 tenderloin with paper
    towels and using dinner fork, scrape flat side lengthwise from end
    to end 5 times, until surface is completely covered with shallow
    grooves. Repeat with second tenderloin.
-   Submerge tenderloins in brine and let stand at room temperature for
    1 hour.

### Glaze

-   Heat oil in small saucepan over medium heat until shimmering.
-   Add in garlic, ginger, and pepper flakes; cook until fragrant, about
    30 seconds.
-   Whisk in hoisin and soy sauce until smooth.
-   Remove pan from heat and stir in vinegar.
-   Transfer 1/3 cup glaze to bowl for grilling; reserve remaining glaze
    for serving.

### Prep Tenderloin

-   Remove tenderloins from brine and pat completely dry with paper
    towels.
-   Lay 1 tenderloin, scraped side up, on cutting board and lay second
    tenderloin, scraped side down, on top so that thick end of 1
    tenderloin matches up with thin end of other.
-   Evenly space twine underneath tenderloins and tie.

## Grill

-   Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15
    minutes.
-   Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).
-   Clean and oil cooking grate.
-   Place roast on cooler side of grill, cover, and cook until meat
    registers 115 degrees, 22 to 28 minutes, flipping and rotating
    halfway through cooking.
-   Slide roast to hotter part of grill and cook until lightly browned
    on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes.
-   Brush top of roast with about 1 tablespoon glaze and grill, glaze
    side down, until glaze begins to char, 2 to 3 minutes; repeat
    glazing and grilling with remaining 3 sides of roast, until meat
    registers 140 degrees.
-   Transfer roast to carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil,
    and let rest for 10 minutes. Carefully remove twine and slice roast
    into ½-inch thick slices. Serve with remaining glaze.
