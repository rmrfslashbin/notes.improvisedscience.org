# Special Equipment

-   Plastic bag large enough to hold the turkey.

# Ingredients

-   1 12 to 16 lb turkey
-   Kosher salt (or half the amount of ground pink salt)
-   Fresh herbs like thyme, rosemary, sage, etc.

# Preparation

-   Two days before serving, rinse turkey and pat dry. Rub all over with
    kosher salt, slipping salt under the skin where possible and rubbing
    some into cavities. Use about 1 tablespoon per 4 pounds of bird (or
    half tablespoon if using pink salt).
-   Wrap bird in a large plastic bag and place in refrigerator. On the
    second night, turn the turkey over. A couple of hours before
    cooking, remove the turkey from bag and pat dry. (There is no need
    to rinse it first.) Place in roasting pan and allow to come to room
    temperature.
-   Roast as desired.
