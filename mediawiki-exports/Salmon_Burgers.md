## Ingredients

-   1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless salmon
-   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
-   2 shallots, peeled and cut into chunks
-   ½ cup coarse bread crumbs
-   1 tablespoon capers, drained
-   Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Preparation

-   Heat gas grill per usual method.
-   Cut/fold 4 squares of heavy foil; large enough to hold a salmon
    burger.
-   Lightly oil the burger side of each foil square.

-   Cut the salmon into large chunks
-   Put ¼ of the salmon and mustard into the container of a food
    processor.
-   Turn the machine on, and let it run -- stopping to scrape down the
    sides if necessary -- until the mixture becomes pasty.
-   Add the shallots and the remaining salmon; pulse the machine on and
    off until the fish is chopped and well combined with the puree. No
    piece should be larger than a quarter inch or so; be careful not
    make the mixture too fine.
-   Scrape the mixture into a bowl
-   By hand, stir in the bread crumbs, capers and some salt and pepper.
-   Shape into four burgers. (You can cover and refrigerate the burgers
    for a few hours at this point.)

## Grill

-   Reduce grill to 50% flame
-   Place burgers on individual foil squares.
-   Grill a few minutes; till burger starts to firm.
-   Flip burgers directly onto grill; remove foil.
-   Grill till almost done; flip once more.
