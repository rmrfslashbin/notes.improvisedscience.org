# Starter

## Ingredients

In a large bowl, combine:

-   702 grams whole-wheat flour
-   708 grams a-p flour

## Start

-   Using a wooden spoon, mix **142 grams flour mixture** and **151
    grams room-temperature water** in a glass bowl until no dry flour
    remains (reserve remaining flour mixture).
-   Cover with **plastic wrap** and let sit at room temperature until
    bubbly and fragrant, **48 to 72 hours**.

## Feed

-   Measure out **57 grams starter** and transfer to clean bowl or jar;
    **discard** remaining starter.
-   Stir **71 grams flour mixture** and **57 grams room-temperature
    water** into the starter until no dry flour remains.
-   Cover with **plastic wrap** and let sit at room temperature for **24
    hours**.

## Daily Maintenance

-   Repeat feeding every **24 hours** until the starter is pleasantly
    aromatic and **doubles in size 8 to 12 hours after being fed**,
    about **10 to 14 days**.
-   At this point starter is mature and ready to be baked with, or it
    can be moved to storage.
-   If baking, use starter once it has doubled in size during
    **8-to-12-hour window**. Use starter within **1 hour** after it
    starts to deflate once reaching its peak.

## Storage

    water** into the starter until no dry flour remains.
-   Transfer to clean container that can be loosely covered (plastic
    container or mason jar with its lid inverted) and let sit at room
    temperature for **5 hours**.
-   Cover and transfer to the refrigerator.
-   If not baking regularly, repeat the process **weekly**.

## Baking

To prepare for baking:

-   **18 to 24 hours** before baking, measure out **113 grams starter**
    and transfer to clean bowl; discard or retain remaining starter for
    another loaf later.
-   Stir **142 grams all-purpose flour** and **113 grams
    room-temperature water** into the starter until no dry flour
    remains.
-   Cover and let sit at room temperature for **5 hours**.
