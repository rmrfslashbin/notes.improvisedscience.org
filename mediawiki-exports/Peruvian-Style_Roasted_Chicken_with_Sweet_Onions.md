## Equipment

-   Large roasting pan

## Preheat Oven

-   Preheat oven to 425°F

## Ingredients

-   1 ½ teaspoon expeller-pressed canola oil, plus more for oiling the
    pan
-   1 ½ tablespoon sweet paprika
-   1 tablespoon ground cumin
-   1 ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
-   1 ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
-   5 cloves garlic, finely chopped
-   2 ½ tablespoons white wine vinegar
-   2 large sweet onions, thickly sliced
-   1 chicken, cut into 10 serving pieces\*
-   2 red or yellow bell peppers, seeded and cut into chunks
-   1 lemon, sliced

## Preparation

-   Oil a large roasting pan and set aside.

### Marinade

-   In a small bowl, combine to make a paste:
    -   Paprika
    -   Cumin
    -   Salt
    -   Pepper
    -   Garlic
    -   Vinegar
    -   Oil

### Combine

-   Place onions in a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of the
    paste.
-   Rub chicken pieces with remaining paste and place in prepared pan,
    then cover with onions, peppers and lemon.

### Roast

-   Roast, basting occasionally with pan juices, until chicken is cooked
    through and vegetables are very tender, about 45 minutes.
-   Remove from oven and let rest 5 minutes before serving.

## Notes

-   If the chicken has been precut into eight pieces, simply cut each
    breast in half through the rib cage to ensure even cooking. Or, you
    can ask your butcher to cut a whole chicken into 10 pieces with
    breasts deboned.
