This Korean doenjang jjigae (된장찌개) is a hearty, soul-warming stew built on the foundation of fermented soybean paste. Traditionally made with tofu and vegetables, this version uses white kidney beans for extra heartiness and protein. The doenjang provides deep, funky, savory umami that's balanced by aromatics, mushrooms, and fresh vegetables. It's the kind of comforting one-pot meal that Korean families eat regularly—simple, nourishing, and deeply satisfying. Serve with steamed rice and kimchi.

**Serves 4 as a main course**

### Ingredients

#### Stew Base
- 5 cups vegetable stock
- 3 tablespoons doenjang (Korean fermented soybean paste)
- 1 tablespoon gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) OR 1 tablespoon Aleppo pepper or Thai red chili flakes
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil

#### Aromatics
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
- 4 scallions, white and light green parts chopped, dark green parts sliced for garnish (keep separate)
- 1 small onion, sliced

#### Vegetables and Protein
- 2 cans (800g total) white kidney beans, drained and rinsed
- 8 oz white mushrooms, quartered or thickly sliced
- 2 medium carrots, sliced into coins
- 2-3 stalks bok choy, stems chopped, leaves separated
- Optional: 1/2 cup kimchi, roughly chopped (adds extra funk and spice)
- Optional: 8 oz firm tofu, cubed (for traditional texture alongside beans)

#### To Serve
- Steamed white or brown rice
- Kimchi (if not added to stew)
- Reserved scallion greens
- Extra sesame oil for drizzling
- Extra gochugaru or chili flakes

### Instructions

1. **Bloom the aromatics**: Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil (or sesame oil) in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add garlic, ginger, scallion whites/light greens, and sliced onion. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until fragrant and softened.

2. **Build the broth**: Add vegetable stock to the pot. In a small bowl, mix doenjang with about 1/2 cup of the hot stock to dissolve it (this prevents lumps). Pour the dissolved doenjang back into the pot along with gochugaru (or substitute), soy sauce, sugar if using, and sesame oil. Stir well and bring to a boil.

3. **Add sturdy ingredients**: Once boiling, reduce heat to medium and add white kidney beans, mushrooms, and carrots. Simmer for 10 minutes until carrots are tender and mushrooms have released their liquid. The flavors should begin to meld.

4. **Add quick-cooking vegetables**: Add bok choy stems and kimchi (if using). Simmer for 3-4 minutes until bok choy stems begin to soften. If using tofu, add it now and simmer gently for 2 minutes.

5. **Finish**: Add bok choy leaves in the last minute—they'll wilt quickly. Taste the broth and adjust:
   - More doenjang for deeper savoriness
   - More gochugaru for heat
   - More soy sauce for saltiness
   - Splash of rice vinegar for brightness (optional)

6. **Serve**: Ladle into bowls over steamed rice. Garnish with sliced scallion greens, a drizzle of sesame oil, and a sprinkle of gochugaru. Serve with kimchi on the side.

### Notes

- **Doenjang is key**: This fermented soybean paste is the soul of jjigae. It's deeply savory, funky, and complex—similar to miso but earthier and more robust. Find it at Korean or Asian grocery stores. Brands like Chung Jung One or Sempio are widely available.

- **Doenjang vs miso**: While related, doenjang is chunkier, funkier, and more intensely flavored than Japanese miso. Don't substitute miso 1:1—it won't give you the same depth. If you must substitute, use red/dark miso and increase the amount slightly.

- **Gochugaru substitute**: Korean chili flakes (gochugaru) have a unique fruity, slightly smoky flavor. Aleppo pepper is the closest substitute, followed by Turkish or Kashmiri chili flakes. Avoid cayenne—it's too sharp.

- **White beans work beautifully**: While non-traditional, white kidney beans absorb the broth's flavors and provide creamy texture and protein. They're heartier than tofu and make this a more substantial meal.

- **Kimchi addition**: Adding kimchi to the stew is common in Korean cooking. It adds another layer of fermented funk, acidity, and spice. Use well-fermented (sour) kimchi for best results.

- **Adjust thickness**: For a brothier jjigae, add more stock. For thicker, stew-like consistency, let it simmer longer to reduce. Traditionally it's somewhere in between—spoonable but not thick.

- **Rice is essential**: Jjigae is always served with rice. The rice balances the intense, salty, funky flavors of the stew. You eat spoonfuls of stew between bites of rice.

- **Make it richer**: Add a beaten egg in the last minute for egg ribbons, or crack a whole egg on top and let it poach in the hot stew.

### Variations

- **Traditional with tofu**: Replace or reduce beans and add 12-16 oz cubed firm or soft tofu.

- **With zucchini**: Add 1 sliced zucchini with the carrots—very traditional in jjigae.

- **Seafood version**: Add clams, mussels, or shrimp in the last 5 minutes (no longer vegan).

- **Spicy boost**: Add 1-2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chili paste) along with the doenjang for extra heat and sweetness.

- **Potato addition**: Add 1-2 cubed potatoes with the carrots for extra heartiness.

### Storage

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. The flavors deepen significantly overnight—leftovers are often better than the first serving. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding stock or water to adjust consistency. The beans will continue absorbing liquid. Freezes well for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in refrigerator before reheating.
