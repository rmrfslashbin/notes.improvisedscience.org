description: "Vegan take on classic mapo tofu using green lentils with doubanjiang, Sichuan peppercorns, and chili oil. Intensely numbing and spicy."
servings: 4
---

This vegan interpretation of the Sichuan classic mapo tofu uses tender green lentils instead of tofu or ground pork. The lentils provide a hearty, meaty texture while absorbing the bold, complex flavors of fermented doubanjiang (broad bean chili paste) and numbing Sichuan peppercorns. The dish achieves the hallmark má là (numbing-spicy) sensation with layers of heat from chili oil and a tingling, almost electric numbness from the peppercorns. Deeply savory, richly spiced, and absolutely addictive served over steamed rice.

**Serves 4 as a main course**

### Ingredients

#### For the Lentils
- 1 cup (200g) dried green lentils (French lentils du Puy work well)
- 3 cups water or vegetable stock
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

#### For the Sichuan Peppercorn Mixture
- 2 tablespoons whole Sichuan peppercorns
- 3 tablespoons neutral oil

#### For the Aromatics and Sauce
- 3 tablespoons neutral oil
- 3 tablespoons doubanjiang (fermented broad bean chili paste)
- 2 tablespoons chili oil (with sediment) OR 1 tablespoon neutral oil + 1 tablespoon chili flakes
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh ginger, minced
- 4 scallions, white and light green parts minced, dark green parts sliced for garnish (keep separate)
- 1 cup vegetable stock
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar or rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water (slurry)

#### To Serve
- Steamed white rice or brown rice
- Reserved scallion greens
- Cilantro leaves (optional)
- Extra chili oil

### Instructions

1. **Cook the lentils**: Rinse lentils and combine with water (or stock) and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low and simmer for 20-25 minutes until tender but still hold their shape. Drain and set aside.

2. **Toast Sichuan peppercorns**: While lentils cook, toast peppercorns in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking frequently, until fragrant and lightly smoking, 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.

3. **Grind peppercorns**: Once cooled, grind half the peppercorns (1 tablespoon) to a coarse powder. Reserve the remaining whole peppercorns.

4. **Make peppercorn oil**: Heat 3 tablespoons neutral oil in a small pan over medium heat. Add the whole toasted peppercorns and fry gently for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Remove from heat and let steep.

5. **Fry the doubanjiang**: Heat 3 tablespoons neutral oil in a large wok or skillet over medium heat. Add doubanjiang and chili oil. Fry, stirring constantly, until the paste darkens and becomes deeply fragrant, 2-3 minutes. The oil should turn brilliant red.

6. **Add aromatics**: Add garlic, ginger, and minced scallion whites/light greens. Stir-fry for 1 minute until fragrant.

7. **Build the sauce**: Pour in vegetable stock, soy sauce, black vinegar, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and let bubble for 2-3 minutes.

8. **Add lentils**: Add the cooked, drained lentils to the sauce. Stir to coat and simmer for 3-4 minutes.

9. **Thicken**: Stir the cornstarch slurry, then pour into the wok while stirring. The sauce will thicken and become glossy. Cook 1 minute more.

10. **Add Sichuan peppercorn flavor**: Stir in about half the ground peppercorn powder and drizzle in 1-2 tablespoons of the peppercorn oil. Taste for numbing sensation.

11. **Serve**: Transfer to a serving dish. Drizzle with more peppercorn oil, sprinkle with remaining peppercorn powder, garnish with scallion greens and cilantro. Serve over steamed rice with extra chili oil.

### Notes

- **Má là explained**: Sichuan cuisine is famous for má là—"numbing-spicy." The má (numbing) comes from Sichuan peppercorns, the là (spicy) from chili peppers. Both work together for the signature flavor.

- **Doubanjiang is essential**: This fermented broad bean and chili paste is the soul of mapo dishes. Pixian doubanjiang is the gold standard. No substitute captures its complexity.

- **Toast peppercorns fresh**: Always toast just before using to release aromatic oils. Pre-ground peppercorns lack intensity.

- **Lentil texture**: Cook until tender but intact. They should hold their shape with slight firmness. Mushy lentils won't work.

- **Adjust numbing level**: Start with half the peppercorn powder and oil, add more to taste. The numbing can be intense for beginners.

- **Chili oil**: Use Chinese chili oil with sediment (settled chili flakes). Lao Gan Ma is widely available.

- **Black vinegar**: Chinese black vinegar (Chinkiang) adds mellow, slightly sweet acidity. Substitute: rice vinegar + tiny splash of balsamic.

- **With tofu**: Add 8 oz cubed silken tofu in the last 2 minutes for traditional mapo texture alongside lentils.

### Storage

Store in refrigerator for up to 4 days. Flavors deepen after a day. Reheat gently, adding stock if needed. Numbing sensation fades over time—add fresh ground peppercorns when serving leftovers. Freezes well for up to 2 months.
