---

This Chinese-inspired hot and sour soup uses tender green lentils instead of traditional bamboo shoots or wood ear mushrooms, creating a heartier, more substantial bowl. The hallmark balance of sour (from rice vinegar) and hot (from white pepper) is perfectly achieved, with silky egg ribbons and a cornstarch-thickened broth that coats the lentils beautifully. It's quick to make, incredibly comforting, and has that perfect interplay of tangy, peppery, savory, and umami flavors. Serve as a starter or light main course.

**Serves 4**

### Ingredients

#### For the Lentils
- 3/4 cup dried green lentils
- 3 cups water or vegetable stock
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

#### For the Soup
- 6 cups vegetable stock
- 8 oz white mushrooms, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce (optional, for color)
- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar (or Chinese black vinegar)
- 1 to 2 teaspoons white pepper (start with 1, add more for heat)
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 3 tablespoons water (slurry)
- 2 eggs, beaten
- Optional: 6 oz firm tofu, cut into matchsticks
- Optional: 1/2 cup bamboo shoots, julienned (traditional)

#### Aromatics
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
- 4 scallions, white and light green parts chopped, dark green parts sliced for garnish (keep separate)

#### To Serve
- Reserved scallion greens
- Extra white pepper
- Extra rice vinegar
- Chili oil or chili flakes (optional)
- Cilantro leaves (optional)

### Instructions

1. **Cook the lentils**: Rinse lentils and combine with water (or stock) and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low and simmer for 20-25 minutes until tender but still hold their shape. Drain and set aside.

2. **Build the broth**: While lentils cook, heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic, ginger, and scallion whites/light greens. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.

3. **Add stock and seasonings**: Pour in vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add mushrooms, soy sauce, dark soy sauce if using, 2 tablespoons rice vinegar (reserve 1 tablespoon for later), white pepper, sugar, and sesame oil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes until mushrooms are tender.

4. **Add lentils and optional ingredients**: Add the cooked, drained lentils to the soup. If using tofu or bamboo shoots, add them now. Simmer for 2-3 minutes to heat through.

5. **Thicken the soup**: Stir the cornstarch slurry to recombine, then slowly pour it into the simmering soup while stirring constantly. The soup will thicken immediately and become silky. Let it simmer for 1 minute.

6. **Add egg ribbons**: Reduce heat to low. Slowly drizzle the beaten eggs into the soup in a thin stream while stirring gently in one direction. The eggs will form delicate ribbons. Don't stir too vigorously or the ribbons will break up.

7. **Finish with vinegar**: Turn off the heat. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon rice vinegar. Taste and adjust:
   - More vinegar for sourness
   - More white pepper for heat
   - More soy sauce for saltiness
   - The soup should be clearly sour and peppery but balanced

8. **Serve**: Ladle into bowls and garnish with sliced scallion greens, a sprinkle of white pepper, and cilantro if using. Serve with extra vinegar and chili oil on the side for customization.

### Notes

- **White pepper is essential**: This is the "hot" in hot and sour soup. White pepper has a sharp, pungent heat that's different from black pepper. Find it in the spice aisle or Asian markets. If you don't have it, use black pepper, but the flavor profile won't be quite right.

- **Balance is key**: Hot and sour soup is all about the interplay between sour (vinegar) and hot (pepper). Start conservatively and adjust to your taste. Some prefer more sour, others more peppery.

- **Vinegar timing**: Add most of the vinegar during cooking, but reserve some to add at the end. This gives you both cooked (mellow) and raw (bright) vinegar notes.

- **Chinese black vinegar**: If you have it, use Chinkiang black vinegar instead of rice vinegar. It adds a deeper, slightly sweet, complex sourness. You can also use a combination of both.

- **Cornstarch technique**: The cornstarch creates the signature silky, slightly thick texture of hot and sour soup. Stir constantly when adding to prevent lumps.

- **Egg ribbon technique**: The key to delicate egg ribbons is to drizzle the beaten egg slowly in a thin stream while stirring gently. The egg cooks instantly in the hot soup.

- **Make it vegan**: Omit the eggs. The soup will still be delicious, just less silky. You can add extra cornstarch slurry for more body.

- **Lentil texture**: Cook lentils until tender but not mushy. They should hold their shape in the soup and provide nice texture contrast.

- **Adjust thickness**: For a thinner soup, use less cornstarch (2 tablespoons instead of 3). For thicker, more stew-like, use 4 tablespoons.

### Variations

- **Traditional additions**: Add julienned wood ear mushrooms (soaked if dried), lily buds, or bamboo shoots for authentic texture.

- **With pork or chicken**: Add 4 oz thinly sliced pork or chicken in step 3, simmering until cooked through (no longer vegetarian).

- **Spicier version**: Add 1-2 teaspoons chili oil or a few drops of Chinese chili crisp with the seasonings.

- **Extra vegetables**: Add julienned carrots, snow peas, or baby corn with the mushrooms.

- **Richer broth**: Use chicken stock instead of vegetable stock (no longer vegan).

### Storage

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Note that the egg ribbons will break down slightly and the soup will thicken as it sits (lentils and cornstarch continue absorbing liquid). Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding stock or water to thin as needed. Add a splash of fresh vinegar when reheating to brighten the flavors. Not recommended for freezing, as the texture of the egg ribbons and cornstarch-thickened broth don't freeze well.
