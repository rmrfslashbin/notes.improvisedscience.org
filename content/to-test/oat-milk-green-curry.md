This green curry takes a creative approach by using oat milk instead of coconut milk, with peanut butter adding the richness and body you'd expect from a proper curry. The result is lighter but still deeply satisfying, with all the bright, spicy, aromatic flavors of traditional Thai green curry. It's a pantry-friendly version that works beautifully with whatever vegetables you have on hand.

**Serves 4 as a main course**

### Ingredients

#### Curry Base
- 2 tablespoons neutral oil (vegetable or canola)
- 3-4 tablespoons Thai green curry paste (start with 3)
- 2 tablespoons natural peanut butter
- 1.5 cups (360ml) oat milk
- 1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable stock
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced

#### Vegetables & Protein
- 1 can (400g/14oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 8 oz (225g) white mushrooms, quartered
- 2 medium carrots, sliced into coins or matchsticks
- 2-3 stalks bok choy, stems chopped, leaves separated

#### Seasonings
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce (reduce to 1 tablespoon if using kecap manis)
- 1 tablespoon kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce) OR 1-2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar or fresh lemon juice
- Salt to taste

#### To Serve
- Rice noodles
- Fresh herbs (cilantro, Thai basil, or mint if available)
- Lemon or lime wedges
- Sliced red chili (optional)

### Instructions

1. **Bloom the curry paste**: Heat oil in a large pot or wok over medium heat. Add curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and darkened slightly, 2-3 minutes. The paste should smell intensely aromatic.

2. **Build the base**: Add minced garlic and ginger to the paste, cooking for 30 seconds until fragrant. Stir in peanut butter and cook until melted and fully incorporated with the curry paste, about 1 minute.

3. **Add liquids**: Pour in oat milk and vegetable stock, whisking to combine everything smoothly. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Don't let it boil vigorously or the oat milk may separate.

4. **Cook the vegetables**: Add carrots and mushrooms first, as they take longer to cook. Simmer for 5-7 minutes until carrots are tender-crisp and mushrooms have released their liquid.

5. **Add quick-cooking items**: Stir in chickpeas and bok choy stems. Cook for 2-3 minutes until bok choy stems begin to soften. Add bok choy leaves in the last minute of cooking—they'll wilt quickly.

6. **Season to perfection**: Stir in soy sauce (or reduced amount if using kecap manis), kecap manis (or sugar), and rice vinegar. Taste and adjust:
   - More curry paste for heat and depth
   - More soy sauce or salt for saltiness
   - More kecap manis or sugar for sweetness
   - More vinegar or citrus for brightness
   - The balance should be spicy-sweet-savory-sour

7. **Prepare noodles and serve**: While curry simmers, cook rice noodles according to package directions. Drain and divide among bowls. Ladle curry over noodles and garnish with fresh herbs, citrus wedges, and sliced chili if using.

### Notes

- **Oat milk substitute**: The combination of oat milk and peanut butter mimics coconut milk's richness without the heaviness. The peanut butter adds protein, creaminess, and a subtle nuttiness that works beautifully with Thai flavors.

- **Kecap manis advantage**: If you have Indonesian sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), use it instead of plain sugar. It adds both sweetness and umami depth, creating a Thai-Indonesian fusion that's fantastic. This is the preferred method.

- **Don't overcook the oat milk**: Keep the heat at a gentle simmer. Aggressive boiling can cause oat milk to separate or become grainy.

- **Consistency adjustment**: The recipe uses 2 cups total liquid for a thick, coating curry. If you prefer a thinner, brothier curry, add more stock 1/4 cup at a time until you reach your desired consistency. Mushrooms will also release liquid as they cook.

- **Curry paste strength**: Green curry paste varies wildly between brands. Start with 3 tablespoons and add more to taste. Thai brands like Maesri or Mae Ploy tend to be more potent than Western supermarket versions.

- **Vegetable flexibility**: This recipe is a template. Swap in what you have: green beans, bell peppers, snap peas, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, or eggplant all work beautifully.

- **Protein additions**: Add cubed tofu (press and pan-fry first for best texture), tempeh, or keep it bean-based. For non-vegan: add fish sauce instead of some soy sauce, or finish with soft-boiled eggs.

- **Make it richer**: If you want more richness without coconut milk, add another tablespoon of peanut butter or a splash of sesame oil at the end.

### Storage

Store curry and noodles separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The curry actually improves overnight as flavors meld. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a splash of stock or water if needed. Cook fresh noodles when serving leftovers for best texture.
