---

This Korean-Italian fusion pasta is a weeknight game-changer: spicy gochujang, funky kimchi, and earthy mushrooms tossed with pasta in a creamy, emulsified sauce. Instead of butter, the sauce uses toasted sesame oil and neutral oil for richness, creating a nutty, aromatic base that pairs perfectly with Korean flavors. The result is creamy, spicy, tangy, and deeply umami—a dish that's both comforting and exciting. It comes together in the time it takes to boil pasta.

**Serves 4**

### Ingredients

#### Pasta
- 12 oz pasta (spaghetti, bucatini, or fettuccine work well)
- Salt for pasta water
- 1.5 cups reserved pasta cooking water

#### Sauce Base (Sesame Oil Method)
- 2 tablespoons neutral oil (vegetable or canola)
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chili paste)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 to 2 teaspoons sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced

#### Vegetables
- 8 oz white mushrooms, sliced
- 1 cup kimchi, roughly chopped (plus extra juice if available)
- 4 scallions, white and light green parts chopped, dark green parts sliced for garnish (keep separate)

#### To Serve
- Reserved scallion greens
- Toasted sesame seeds
- Extra gochujang or chili flakes
- Crispy fried shallots or garlic (optional)
- Nori strips (optional, for umami)

### Instructions

1. **Cook the pasta**: Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1.5 cups pasta cooking water before draining. Do not rinse the pasta.

2. **Cook the mushrooms**: While pasta cooks, heat 2 tablespoons neutral oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add sliced mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and their liquid has evaporated, 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt.

3. **Build the sauce base**: Push mushrooms to the side of the pan. Add sesame oil, garlic, and ginger to the center. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant, then mix with the mushrooms.

4. **Add gochujang and kimchi**: Add gochujang, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sugar to the pan. Stir to combine and cook for 1 minute until the gochujang is fragrant and slightly darkened. Add chopped kimchi and scallion whites/light greens. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until kimchi is heated through.

5. **Emulsify the sauce**: Reduce heat to medium. Add 1 cup of the reserved pasta water to the pan. Stir vigorously to emulsify the gochujang and oils into a creamy sauce. Let it simmer and reduce slightly for 2-3 minutes. The sauce should be glossy and coat the back of a spoon.

6. **Toss the pasta**: Add the drained pasta to the sauce. Toss continuously, adding more pasta water a little at a time if needed, until the pasta is well coated and the sauce clings to each strand. The starch from the pasta water will help create a silky, emulsified sauce.

7. **Adjust and serve**: Taste and adjust seasoning:
   - More gochujang for heat
   - More soy sauce for saltiness
   - More vinegar for brightness
   - More sugar for balance
   - More pasta water for creaminess

   Transfer to serving bowls. Garnish with sliced scallion greens, toasted sesame seeds, and any optional toppings. Serve immediately.

### Notes

- **Why sesame oil instead of butter**: Toasted sesame oil adds a nutty, aromatic richness that complements Korean flavors better than butter. The neutral oil provides body and helps emulsify the sauce. Together they create a creamy, glossy sauce without dairy.

- **Alternative fat options**:
  - **Doenjang emulsion**: Use 1 tablespoon doenjang + 2 tablespoons neutral oil + pasta water for deeper umami
  - **Miso-oil**: Use 1 tablespoon white or red miso + 2 tablespoons neutral oil
  - **Pasta water only**: Skip the oils entirely and rely on vigorous tossing with pasta water for emulsification (lighter, less rich)
  - **Traditional butter**: Use 3 tablespoons butter if you prefer (no longer vegan)

- **Gochujang intensity**: Korean chili paste varies in heat and sweetness by brand. Start with 3 tablespoons and add more to taste. The sauce should be spicy but not overwhelming.

- **Kimchi choice**: Use well-fermented, sour kimchi for best results. The funk and acidity balance the richness of the sauce. Drain slightly if very wet, but save the juice—it adds great flavor.

- **Pasta water is key**: The starchy pasta water is essential for creating a creamy, emulsified sauce. Don't skip reserving it, and add it gradually while tossing.

- **Timing**: This dish comes together quickly. Have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking. The pasta and sauce should be ready at the same time.

- **Make it richer**: Add a beaten egg yolk at the end (off heat) for carbonara-style creaminess. Toss quickly to coat.

- **Cheese option**: Top with grated Parmesan or pecorino if you want fusion comfort (no longer vegan). The salty, nutty cheese works surprisingly well with Korean flavors.

### Variations

- **Protein additions**: Add pan-fried tofu cubes, crispy chickpeas, or (for non-vegan) a fried egg on top, thinly sliced pork belly, or shrimp.

- **Extra vegetables**: Add bok choy, spinach, or snap peas in the last minute of cooking.

- **Spicy boost**: Add gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) or Aleppo pepper with the mushrooms, or drizzle with chili oil when serving.

- **Creamy version**: Stir in 2-3 tablespoons cream cheese or mascarpone at the end for extra richness (no longer vegan).

- **Noodle swap**: Use fresh ramen noodles, udon, or rice noodles instead of pasta for a more Asian-leaning dish.

### Storage

Best served immediately while the pasta is hot and the sauce is freshly emulsified. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, but the pasta will absorb the sauce and become less creamy. Reheat gently in a skillet with a splash of water or stock to loosen the sauce. Add a drizzle of sesame oil to refresh. Not recommended for freezing.
