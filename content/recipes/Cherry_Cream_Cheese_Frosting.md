I first made this recipe to frost a double-layer 9" round chocolate
cake. This recipe produced enough frosting to top each of the rounds
(filling between the two rounds, plus the top). If it is desired to fill
& frost both the sides and top, the recipe could be doubled. Depending
on the strength of the flavor of the cherry preserves, you may need more
or less. Also, due to the varying consistencies of various preserves,
more or less confectioners' sugar may be needed. Ultimately, the finial
consistency of the icing is up to the chef and the intended use.

Most any sort of fruit preserves could be use: strawberry, blueberry,
blackberry, apricot, etc.

## Special Equipment

-   Stand mixer

## Ingredients

-   56 grams unsalted butter, softened
-   250 grams cream cheese, cold, cut into cubes
-   460 grams confectioners' (icing) sugar, sifted
-   1 teaspoons (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
-   Pinch of salt
-   2 tablespoons (30 mL) cherry preserves, or to taste

## Preparation

Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle:

-   Beat butter and sugar on medium/low speed until combined (about 2
    minutes).
-   While continuing to beat, add cubed cream cheese; beat for an
    additional 2 minutes.
-   Add vanilla.
-   Add salt.
-   Beat for another minute; but be sure to not over-beat as the
    frosting will become too thin.
-   At low speed, add cherry preserves.

## Taste and Test

Taste the frosting and add more preserves if desired. If the frosting is
too thin, at a little more sugar. If it is too thick, add more preserves
(if the flavor tolerates), or a little milk.
