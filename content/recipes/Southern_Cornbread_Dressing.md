## Equipment

## Preheat Oven

Preheat oven to 450°F.

## Ingredients

-   One recipe [cornbread]({{< ref "/recipes/cornbread" >}})
-   3 cups soft white bread, crust removed and torn or cut into 1-inch pieces (do not pack)
-   ½ cup butter (1 stick), plus more for the pan
-   2 cups chopped sweet onions
-   1 ½ cups chopped celery (4 or 5 stalks)
-   1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
-   2 eggs
-   1 ¼ tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage
-   1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
-   ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
-   4 to 5 cups rich chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock

## Preparation

### Dry Cornbread

-   After baking and cooling cornbread, dice into ½" cubes.
-   Spread cornbread cubes in a single layer on a lined baking sheet.
-   Leave to dry several days, or leave overnight in an oven at about 150°F.

### Combine Breads

-   Heat oven to 350°F.
-   Combine **cornbread** and **white bread** in a large bowl, tossing to mix, and breaking cornbread into smaller pieces.

### Vegetables

-   Melt **butter** in a large skillet.
-   Add **onions**, **celery** and ½ teaspoon **salt**.
-   Sauté until vegetables have softened, about **6 minutes**.
-   Add vegetables to bread mixture and combine.

### Final Steps

-   Lightly beat **eggs** and add to bowl.
-   Sprinkle in **herbs**
-   Add remaining 1 teaspoon **salt** and the **pepper** and toss together.
-   Add 4 cups **broth** and stir well.
-   Using your hands, work the mixture to get a very lumpy, thick, batter-like consistency.
-   Add another cup of **stock** if needed.
-   The mixture should be very wet and pourable but without standing liquid.

### Bake

-   Butter an 8-by-11-inch baking dish.
-   Pour the mixture into the baking dish and bake until dressing puffs slightly and has browned well around the edges, about **45 minutes** to **1 hour**.
-   If you have drippings from a roasted turkey, spoon some over the top about **30 minutes** into the baking time.
