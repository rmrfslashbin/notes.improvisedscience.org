There's a few variations for a rye loaf and a spelt loaf.

## Method

### Sponge and ferment

Time: 4.5 hours

-   In a stand mixer bowl, combine **sponge** ingredients and whisk
    until very smooth.
-   In a second bowl, combine **mixture** ingredients. Whisk to just to
    incorporate.
-   Sprinkle all of the **mixture** atop the **sponge**. DO NOT MIX. You
    should now have a layer of liquid sponge under a layer of dry
    flours.
-   Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a warm damp towel and let
    ferment for **4 hours** at a warm room temp or "proof" setting in
    oven.

### Kneed and first rise

Time: 1.75 hours

-   Uncover fermenting mixture and pour olive oil atop mixture.
-   Using stand mixer with dough hook, combine on lowest speed.
-   Once combined, increase speed to low-med and kneed for 10 minutes
    (setting #2 or #3 on my KitchenAid)
-   Using additional olive oil, lubricate the inside of a large glass
    bowl.
-   Remove dough from stand mixer bowl and place in large glass bowl,
    ensuring all side of the dough are covered in olive oil.
-   Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for **1.5 hours** at a warm
    room temp or "proof" setting in oven.

### Punch down and second rise

Time: 1.5 hours

-   Uncover bowl.
-   Punch down dough and lightly kneed to distribute gas.
-   Flip dough over in bowl.
-   Re-cover and let rise for **1.5 hours** at a warm room temp or
    "proof" setting in oven.

### Punch down, loaf pan, and third rise

Time: 45 minutes

-   Grease or oil a 1.5 lb loaf pan.
-   Punch down dough and lightly kneed to distribute gas.
-   Transfer dough to loaf pan.
-   Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for **45 minutes** at a warm
    room temp or "proof" setting in oven.

### Pre-heat Oven

-   If proofing in oven, remove loaf to countertop.
-   Adjust oven rack to lowest position.
-   If using, place baking stone on rack.
-   Heat oven to 450°F/230°C
-   While heating, slash the top f the bread loaf and continue to let
    rise until oven is heated.

### Bake

-   Uncover and place loaf on baking stone.
-   Toss in about 1 cup of ice cubes on floor oven and immediately shut
    door.
-   Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 400°F/205°C
-   Bake another 15 minutes and check internal temperate of loaf. The
    loaf is done with temperature measures between 190°F/88&degC and
    200°F/93°C.
