This vibrant Turkish salad traditionally features nubby mung beans paired with roasted red peppers, fresh herbs, and a tangy pomegranate molasses dressing. This version uses French lentils du Puy as a substitute, since dried mung beans can be difficult to source in the US. The lentils provide a similar firm texture while being widely available. The dish balances earthy legumes with bright citrus, aromatic cumin and sumac, and the fresh bite of mint and dill. Simple yet layered with flavor, it works equally well as a substantial side dish or light vegetarian main course. Serve at room temperature or chilled.

## Equipment
- Large saucepan (3-quart or larger)
- Colander
- Large mixing bowl
- Measuring cups and spoons

## Ingredients

### For the Lentils
- 1 cup (200g) lentils du Puy (French green lentils), rinsed and drained
- 5 cups (1.2L) water
- 1 teaspoon (6g) kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

### For the Dressing
- 1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) pomegranate molasses
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper (or substitute: 1 teaspoon sweet paprika plus 1/4 teaspoon cayenne)
- 1 teaspoon ground sumac
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

### For the Salad
- 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 Fresno chili, stemmed, seeded, and thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup (75g) drained roasted red peppers, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1/2 cup (15g) lightly packed fresh mint, roughly chopped
- 1/2 cup (15g) lightly packed fresh dill, roughly chopped

## Instructions

### Cook the Lentils (25 minutes)
1. **Simmer the lentils**: Combine lentils, water, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper in a large saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender but still hold their shape, about 25 minutes.

2. **Drain thoroughly**: Pour lentils into a colander and shake well to remove as much water as possible. Transfer immediately to a large bowl.

### Dress While Warm
3. **Add dressing to hot lentils**: Immediately add olive oil, pomegranate molasses, lemon juice, Aleppo pepper, sumac, cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and black pepper to the hot lentils. Stir to combine.

4. **Cool completely**: Let dressed lentils cool to room temperature, stirring once or twice during cooling, about 20-30 minutes.

### Finish and Serve
5. **Add fresh ingredients**: Once lentils are completely cool, add red onion, Fresno chili, roasted red peppers, mint, and dill. Gently toss to combine.

6. **Season and serve**: Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt and black pepper as needed. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.

## Notes

- **Traditional ingredient**: This Turkish salad traditionally uses dried mung beans, which have a nubby texture. Mung beans can be hard to find in the US, so this recipe substitutes French lentils du Puy, which cook up with a similar firm texture.
- **Using mung beans**: If you find dried mung beans and want to make the traditional version, use 1 cup mung beans and extend cooking time to about 30 minutes.
- **Dress while warm**: Add the dressing to hot lentils immediately after draining. Warm lentils absorb seasonings much better than cooled ones.
- **Cool before adding herbs**: Wait until lentils are fully cooled before adding onion, chili, peppers, and herbs. This keeps these ingredients fresh and prevents wilting.
- **Pomegranate molasses**: Find this tart, concentrated syrup in Middle Eastern markets or specialty stores. No direct substitute captures its unique flavor.
- **Sumac**: This tangy, lemony spice is essential to the dish's flavor profile. Available at Middle Eastern markets and many supermarkets.
- **Make-ahead friendly**: Cook, dress, and cool the lentils up to 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Add remaining ingredients just before serving.
- **Serving temperature**: This salad is delicious both chilled and at room temperature. Remove from refrigerator 15-20 minutes before serving if you prefer room temperature.

## Variations

- **Grain addition**: Add 1 cup cooked bulgur or farro for a heartier dish.
- **Protein boost**: Top with crumbled feta cheese or dollops of Greek yogurt (no longer vegan).
- **Heat adjustment**: Reduce or omit Fresno chili for milder heat. Add extra cayenne for more spice.

## Storage

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The flavors deepen and meld over time. Stir before serving and adjust seasoning if needed. Not recommended for freezing, as the fresh herbs and vegetables lose their texture.
