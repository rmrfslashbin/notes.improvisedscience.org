-   5 poblano peppers, halved, stemmed and seeded
-   2 red bell peppers, seeded, stemmed and cut into quarters
-   1 cup cashews
-   1 tablespoon cider vinegar

-   1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese or nondairy cheddar-style cheese

## Preparation

### Roast Peppers and Chicken

-   Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment
    paper.
-   Place chicken on one side of the baking sheet and poblano and bell
    peppers on the other side.
-   Roast, stirring peppers once or twice until peppers are browned and
    chicken is just cooked through, 40 to 45 minutes.
-   Cool slightly, then remove and discard skin and bone from chicken
    and shred meat.
-   Dice peppers.

### Cashew Cream

    with boiling water.
-   Let soak 30 minutes.
-   Drain and discard soaking liquid.
-   In a food processor, combine cashews, ½ cup water, vinegar, salt and
    cayenne, and blend until smooth; add more water a tablespoon at a
    time, if necessary, to purée.

### Salsa and Broth

### Construct Casserole

-   Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F.
-   Layer 1/3 of the tortillas in the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole
    dish.
-   Spoon ½ cup of the salsa/both mixture over the tortillas.
-   Top with half the chicken and half the roasted peppers, and drizzle
    with half of the cashew cream.
-   Repeat layering again, finishing with a layer of tortillas and salsa
    mixture.
-   Sprinkle with cheese and bake until bubbling and golden brown, about
    35 minutes.
