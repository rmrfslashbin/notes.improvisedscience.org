High-heat roasting transforms cauliflower wedges into golden, caramelized pieces with crispy edges and tender centers. This simple technique preserves the vegetable's natural shape while developing deep, nutty flavors.

## Ingredients

- 1 medium head cauliflower (approximately 900g/2 pounds)
- 60ml (4 tablespoons) olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Optional Variations
- Spices: cumin, coriander, paprika, or za'atar
- Alternative oils: avocado oil, grapeseed oil, or ghee
- Finishing touches: lemon juice, tahini sauce, or herb oil

## Equipment

- Half-sheet pan (18" x 13") or large rimmed baking sheet
- Parchment paper or silicone baking mat
- Aluminum foil
- Sharp chef's knife
- Spatula (preferably offset or fish spatula)

## Instructions

### Preparation

- **Position oven rack**: Move rack to the lowest position in the oven.
- **Preheat oven**: Heat to 475째F (245째C).
- **Prepare baking sheet**: Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.

### Cutting the Cauliflower

- **Trim cauliflower**: Remove any outer leaves and trim the stem flush with the bottom of the head, creating a flat base.
- **Cut into wedges**: Stand cauliflower upright on its base. Cut the head in half through the core, then cut each half into 4 equal wedges, creating 8 total wedges. Keep the core intact to hold florets together.

### Seasoning

- **Arrange on sheet**: Place cauliflower wedges cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them evenly.
- **Season first side**: Drizzle 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil over the wedges. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Gently rub to distribute evenly.
- **Flip and season second side**: Carefully turn each wedge to expose the other cut side. Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

### Roasting Process

1. **Stage 1 - Covered roasting (10 minutes)**: Cover the baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil. Place in oven and roast for 10 minutes.

2. **Stage 2 - Uncovered roasting (8-12 minutes)**: Remove foil and continue roasting until the bottom sides are golden brown, 8-12 minutes.

3. **Stage 3 - Flip and final roasting (8-12 minutes)**: Remove sheet from oven. Using a spatula, carefully flip each wedge. Return to oven and roast until golden all over, 8-12 minutes longer.

### Serving

- **Final seasoning**: Remove from oven and season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
- **Garnish and serve**: Drizzle with additional olive oil or desired sauce. Serve immediately while hot and crispy.

## Notes

- **Cauliflower size**: A medium head (900g/2 pounds) yields 8 substantial wedges. Adjust cooking time for larger or smaller heads.
- **Core importance**: Keeping the core intact prevents florets from falling apart during roasting
- **Temperature matters**: The high heat (475째F) is crucial for achieving caramelization
- **Initial covering**: The foil steaming step ensures the cauliflower cooks through before browning
- **Don't overcrowd**: Space wedges apart for proper air circulation and even browning
- **Color indicator**: Look for deep golden-brown color on all surfaces for best flavor

## Variations

- **Spiced version**: Add 1 teaspoon ground cumin and 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika to the oil
- **Middle Eastern style**: Finish with tahini sauce, pomegranate seeds, and fresh herbs
- **Indian-inspired**: Use ghee instead of oil and season with turmeric and garam masala
- **Lemon-herb**: Finish with lemon zest, fresh parsley, and a squeeze of lemon juice

## Storage

Best served immediately. Leftovers can be stored covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a 400째F oven for 5-10 minutes to restore crispness.
