This recipe was modified to remove the kale and yield more of a stew
type of consistency.

## Equipment

-   8 quart soup/stew pot

## Ingredients

-   455 grams (1 lb) dried beans (half of each: Great Northern and
    Pinto)
-   2 onions, coarsely chopped
-   2 tablespoons olive oil
-   4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
-   5 cups chicken broth
-   2 qt water
-   1 (3- by 2-inch) piece Parmigiano-Reggiano rind
-   2 teaspoons salt
-   ½ teaspoon black pepper
-   1 bay leaf
-   1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
-   1 lb smoked sausage such as kielbasa (optional), sliced crosswise ¼
    inch thick
-   8 carrots, halved lengthwise and cut crosswise into ½-inch pieces

## Preparation

### Soak Beans

(I found this was not sufficient; needs a better method)

-   Cover beans with water by 2 inches in a pot and bring to a boil.
-   Remove from heat and let stand, uncovered, 1 hour.
-   Drain beans in a colander and rinse.

### Prepare Soup

-   In the soup/stew pot, cook onions in oil over moderately low heat,
    stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.
-   Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute.
-   Add:
    -   Beans
    -   Broth
    -   1 quart water
    -   Cheese rind
    -   Salt
    -   Pepper
    -   Bay leaf
    -   Rosemary
-   Simmer, uncovered, until beans are just tender, about 50 minutes.

### Brown Sausage

While soup is simmering, brown sausage (if using) in batches in a heavy
skillet over moderate heat, turning, then transfer to paper towels to
drain.

### Finish

-   Stir carrots into soup and simmer 5 minutes.
-   Stir sausage
-   Add remaining quart water

Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally about 12 to 15 minutes; or
until desired consistency.
