## Ingredients

### For the Pasta
- Salt for pasta water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed
- 2 medium leeks, trimmed, white and light green parts thinly sliced (about 500ml/2 cups)
- 680g (1½ pounds) mushrooms (such as cremini, shiitake and/or oyster mushrooms), stemmed and sliced
- 450g (1 pound) short pasta, such as ziti or cavatappi
- 2 tablespoons white miso
- 180ml (¾ cup) grated Parmesan, plus more for garnishing
- 1 tablespoon sherry or red wine vinegar, plus more to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped parsley leaves and tender stems

## Equipment
- Large pot for pasta
- Dutch oven or deep 12-inch skillet
- Colander
- Measuring cups and spoons

## Instructions

### Stage 1: Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Start the pasta water**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

### Stage 2: Cook the Vegetables (15 minutes)
2. **Sauté the leeks**: Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a Dutch oven or deep 12-inch skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add the leeks, season with salt and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes. If they look dry at any point, add a drizzle of oil.

3. **Add mushrooms**: Add the mushrooms to the leeks, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring every 2 minutes, until the mushrooms have browned, about 10 minutes. (If they are done before the pasta, then adjust the heat to low.)

### Stage 3: Cook the Pasta (10-12 minutes)
4. **Cook pasta and reserve water**: When the water is ready, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Halfway through the cooking process, reserve 250ml (1 cup) of water and let cool slightly on the counter. Drain the pasta in a colander and drizzle with olive oil if done before the mushrooms.

### Stage 4: Combine and Finish (2 minutes)
5. **Create the sauce**: When both the mushrooms and pasta are done, stir the miso into the reserved pasta water until mostly dissolved. Add it to the Dutch oven or skillet over medium-high heat along with the pasta, cheese and vinegar, stirring vigorously until a cheesy sauce forms and coats the noodles, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and season to taste with more vinegar if needed.

6. **Serve**: Garnish with the parsley and more cheese; serve with a final drizzle of oil.

## Notes
- **Mushroom Selection**: Mix different mushroom varieties for more complex flavors. Cremini provides earthiness, shiitake adds umami depth, and oyster mushrooms contribute a delicate texture.
- **Miso Type**: White miso (shiro miso) is milder and sweeter than other varieties. Red miso can be substituted for a more intense flavor.
- **Pasta Water**: The starchy pasta water is crucial for creating the sauce - make sure to reserve it before draining.
- **Timing**: If components finish at different times, the pasta can be tossed with olive oil to prevent sticking, and the mushrooms can be kept warm on low heat.

## Variations
- **Whole Grain Option**: Use farro, spelt, or whole-wheat pasta for added nutrition and a nuttier flavor that complements the mushrooms
- **Protein Addition**: Add cooked chicken or crispy tofu for extra protein
- **Greens**: Stir in baby spinach or arugula at the end for added nutrients
- **Spice**: Add red pepper flakes with the leeks for heat

## Storage
- **Refrigerate**: Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days
- **Reheat**: Add a splash of water or broth when reheating to loosen the sauce
- **Not recommended for freezing**: The creamy sauce may separate when thawed
