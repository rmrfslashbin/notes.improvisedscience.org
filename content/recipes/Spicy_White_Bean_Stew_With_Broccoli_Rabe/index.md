**Yield:** 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 1 large bunch (or 2 small bunches) broccoli rabe or kale, thick stems separated from the leaves
- **¼ cup** (60 ml) olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 medium red or yellow onion, thinly sliced
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- **2 to 3 tablespoons** (30-45 grams) harissa or tomato paste
- Red-pepper flakes (Aleppo peppers work well)
- 3 (15-ounce) cans large beans, such as pinto, navy, cannellini, butter or great Northern, drained and rinsed
- **4 cups** (960 ml) vegetable broth
- 1 preserved lemon, thinly sliced, or 1 lemon, halved, for squeezing
- **1 cup** (about 60 grams) parsley or cilantro, leaves and tender stems
- **2 ounces** (56 grams) feta or other salty cheese, such as queso fresco or pecorino, crumbled (optional)
- Fried or medium-boiled eggs, for serving (optional)

## Preparation

**Step 1**  
Tear broccoli rabe or kale leaves into bite-size pieces and set aside. Chop the stems into about **¼-inch** pieces; set aside.

**Step 2**  
Heat **¼ cup** olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and sizzled at the edges, 4 to 6 minutes.

**Step 3**  
Add harissa (or tomato paste and a pinch of red-pepper flakes), and stir to coat in the oil. Cook until the harissa is a nice brick red color, the sugars start to caramelize and the oil turns a nice vibrant fiery orange color, about 2 minutes.

**Step 4**  
Add beans, and season with salt and pepper. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, crush a few beans to release their creamy interior.

**Step 5**  
Add the broth and reserved stems, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until you’ve reached your desired consistency (less time for a brothier soup, more time for a thicker stew), 15 to 20 minutes.

**Step 6**  
Add broccoli rabe or kale leaves and preserved lemon or lemon juice, and stir to wilt the greens. Season with salt, pepper, and more red-pepper flakes if you want it spicier.

**Step 7**  
Serve with feta and parsley, and with eggs, if you like.
