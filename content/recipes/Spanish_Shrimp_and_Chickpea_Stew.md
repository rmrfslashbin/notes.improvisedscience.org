## Notes

This is a solid recipe, but might do well with a few tweaks.

-   The "sauce" at might be better if developed as a roux. Browned butter with a little flour?
-   Also, the flavor profile could use a little more umami- fish sauce, worcestershire, or soy sauce.

## Special Equipment

-   Large dutch oven
-   Slotted spoon
