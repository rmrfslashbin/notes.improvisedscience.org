## Equipment
- Food processor
- Mini baking cups and/or -- parchment lined baking sheet

## Ingredients
- 280 grams (2 ½ cups) vanilla (Nilla) wafers, broken/crushed into large chunks
- 125 grams (1 ¼ cups) toasted pecans
- ½ cup bourbon (*see note*)
- 120 grams (1 cup) confectioners'/powdered sugar, plus more for rolling
- ⅓ cup cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon honey
- Flaky/course salt- optional (*see note*)


## Preparation
- In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the cookies and pecans to a fine crumb.
- In a small bowl, wisk together:
  - Bourbon
  - Confectioner's sugar
  - Cocoa powder
  - Honey
- Pour liquid over the cookie/pecan crumbs in the food processor bowl.
- Pulse in food processor just until combined.
- Transfer dough to a clean bowl. Cover with a towel (do not cover airtight) and let stand overnight.
- Roll the dough into balls about 1 inch in diameter. 
- Toss in confectioners' sugar and salt (optional) then place mini baking cups or on a parchment paper lined pan.
- Store airtight for a more moist crumb, or store lightly covered to develop a crunchy exterior.
- If desired, toss with more powdered sugar before serving.

## Notes
- For high-proof bourbon, reduce the amount of bourbon measured into a ½ cup measuring cup; add water to make up remaining volume. For a 120 proof bourbon, try ¼ cup each, bourbon and water.
- To counter the sweetness of the balls, consider adding a flaky or crunchy salt to the finishing confectioners' sugar.
