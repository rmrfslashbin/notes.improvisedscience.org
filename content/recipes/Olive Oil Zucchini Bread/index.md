## Ingredients
**Yield: One 8-inch loaf**

- Butter, for the pan
- 185g grated zucchini (1½ cups)
- 105g light brown sugar (½ cup)
- 80ml olive oil (⅓ cup) (or other oil such as safflower or canola)
- 80ml plain Greek yogurt (⅓ cup)
- 2 large eggs
- 5ml vanilla extract (1 teaspoon)
- 190g all-purpose flour (1½ cups)
- 3g salt (½ teaspoon)
- 3g baking soda (½ teaspoon)
- 2g baking powder (½ teaspoon)
- 4g ground cinnamon (1½ teaspoons)
- 1g ground nutmeg (¼ teaspoon)
- 2g finely grated lemon zest (1 teaspoon)
- 55g chopped walnuts (½ cup) (optional)

## Method

1. **Preheat oven:** Heat oven to 175°C (350°F). Butter an 8-inch loaf pan.

2. **Mix wet ingredients:** In a large bowl, use a rubber spatula to mix together the grated zucchini, sugar, olive oil, yogurt, eggs and vanilla extract.

3. **Combine dry ingredients:** Whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, lemon zest and spices in a separate bowl. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Fold in the walnuts if using.

4. **Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 40 to 55 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking. The bread will be done when a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean.

5. **Cool:** Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove the bread from the pan and cool on a rack completely before cutting and serving.
