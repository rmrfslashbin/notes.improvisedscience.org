## Source

Recipe from JR Ryall, adapted by David Tanis. Featured in "Spring Comes Early With This Bright, Cozy Dinner" by David Tanis for The New York Times.

## Equipment

- 5-cup ceramic or glass baking dish (or Pyrex pie plate), or 6-7 single-serve ramekins
- Medium mixing bowl
- Large mixing bowl
- Wooden spoon
- Whisk
- Stand mixer (optional, for whipping egg whites)

## Ingredients

- 15 grams (1 tablespoon) unsalted butter, softened
- 225 grams (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs, yolks and whites separated
- 30 grams (3 tablespoons) all-purpose flour
- 2 large lemons, grated and juiced (about 2 tablespoons zest and 90 ml (6 tablespoons) juice)
- 250 ml (1 cup) whole milk
- Confectioners' sugar, for dusting
- Softly whipped cream, for serving

## Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F) and set a rack in the middle of the oven.
2. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the softened butter with the sugar. Using a wooden spoon, mash the mixture until it resembles damp sand.
3. Mix the egg yolks into the sugar mixture, then beat in the flour.
4. Add the lemon zest and juice, then whisk in the milk.
5. In a separate clean large bowl, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks. (You can use a stand mixer for this step if preferred.)
6. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter by hand.

## Cooking

1. Pour the mixture into either:
   - A prepared 5-cup ceramic or glass baking dish, or
   - 6 to 7 single-serve ramekins (about 180-200 ml capacity each)
2. If using the 5-cup baking dish, bake in the middle of the oven for about 40 minutes, or until the mixture is just set and the top is golden brown.
3. If using individual ramekins, bake for about 20 minutes, or until set and golden brown on top.

## Notes

- The pudding will separate into distinct layers as it bakes, creating a custardy bottom and a spongy top.
- This recipe is part of JR Ryall's cookbook "Ballymaloe Desserts."

## Storage

- This pudding is best served warm, shortly after baking.
- If storage is necessary, cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Reheat gently before serving.

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve warm, dusted with confectioners' sugar.
- Offer softly whipped cream alongside for guests to add as desired.
