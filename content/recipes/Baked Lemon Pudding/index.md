This delightful Baked Lemon Pudding, adapted from JR Ryall's "Ballymaloe Desserts" cookbook, offers a perfect balance of tangy and sweet flavors. As it bakes, it naturally separates into two distinct layers: a custardy bottom and a spongy top.

## Ingredients

- 15 g (1 tablespoon) unsalted butter, softened
- 225 g (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs, separated
- 30 g (3 tablespoons) all-purpose flour
- 2 large lemons, zested and juiced (about 30 ml zest and 90 ml juice)
- 250 ml (1 cup) whole milk
- Confectioners' sugar, for dusting
- Softly whipped cream, for serving

## Equipment

- 1.2 L (5-cup) ceramic or glass baking dish
- Medium mixing bowl
- Large mixing bowl
- Wooden spoon
- Whisk
- Electric mixer (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F) and position a rack in the middle.

2. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the softened butter with the sugar. Using a wooden spoon, mash and mix until the mixture resembles damp sand.

3. Add the egg yolks to the sugar mixture and mix well. Beat in the flour until combined.

4. Stir in the lemon zest and juice, then whisk in the milk until smooth.

5. In a separate large, clean bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. You can use an electric mixer for this step if preferred.

6. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the lemon mixture by hand, being careful not to overmix.

7. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.

8. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the pudding is just set and the top is golden brown.

9. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.

10. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving warm, accompanied by softly whipped cream.

## Notes

- For individual servings, bake in ramekins or custard cups for about 20 minutes.
- This dessert is best served warm but can also be enjoyed at room temperature.

Enjoy this bright and cozy lemon pudding as a delightful end to any meal!
