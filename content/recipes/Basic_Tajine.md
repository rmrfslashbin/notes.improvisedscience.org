A [Tajine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajine) is a versatile clay pot
with a conical lid which lends itself to slow cooked, flavor infused
foods. The process in preping and cooking a dish is typically the same
across most recipes:

-   Brown meats in a skillet (or in the tajine if it's compatible with
    your stove top)
-   Cook root and other hearty vegetables.
-   Add spices (like, [Moroccan
    Seasoning](Moroccan_Seasoning "wikilink")).
-   Layer the meats and spiced veggies into the tajine.
-   Add cooking liquid.
-   Cover and place into a cold oven.
-   Cool at about 350°F for about 1.5 to 2 hours.
-   Server with couscous, rice, quinoa, or other similar grain.

## Pre-soak

To make the best use of a tajine pot, pre-soak the base and lid,
submerged in water, for at least one hour before use.

## Proteins

Tejine recipes can include various proteins:

-   Chicken
-   Lamb
-   Fish
-   Tofu

## Vegetable/Legume

Typical vegetables found in common recipes:

-   Onions
-   Garlic
-   Potatoes (usually waxy varieties)
-   Sweet potatoes (keep towards the top of the food pile to avoid water
    waterlogging)
-   Chickpeas
-   Lentils
-   Peas
-   Green beans
-   Okra

## Seasonings

A tajine can be flavored in any style you desire. Traditionally, warm
spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cardamon are used.
Additionally, cumin, coriander, ginger, and garlic are found in many
dishes. Honey is often used to temper the bitterness of raw spices.

## Cooking

Some tajines can be placed directly over flame; check the usage
instructions for your specific pot. As an alternative, a good cast iron
skillet can be used to brown/prep meats and veggies, then transferred to
the tajine pot.

A tajine should never be placed into a hot oven; the clay pot will
surely crack. Instead, place the tajine, food inside with lid affixed,
onto a rack positioned in the lower/middle portion of a cold oven. Set
the temp to roughly 350°F and allow the oven and tajine heat together.

After about 1.5 to 2 hours, remove the tajine to a proper temperature
sensitive surface (ie: not a cold granite counter top). Tip the lid away
from your face to avoid steam burns. Let the steam vent out, then slowly
remove the lid from the base.

## Serving

The tajine can be presented directly to the dinner table. Serve with a
side of fluffy couscous, quinoa, brown rice, or other similar grain.

## Clean-up

Clean up should be simple: warm soapy water and a soft cloth. Do not use
anything harsh or scratchy which would damage the finish of the tajine.
Store in a dry spot.

## Recipes

Tajine recipes are plentiful. A little googling will yield recipes both
from big-name sources and transcribed family recipes handed down by
generations. Most recipes are forgiving to variations and mistakes. Most
all recipes are based on rough estimates and intuition. It's really more
about the look, feel, and taste- as opposed to precise measurements,
skills, and cooking time. It's your tajine, it's your food. Make the
best of it!
