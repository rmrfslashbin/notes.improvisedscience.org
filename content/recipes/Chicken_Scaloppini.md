Sautéed chicken cutlets with a quick pan sauce make an ideal weeknight
meal, and with a few tweaks, we perfected the classic. Most recipes call
for browning the chicken before building the sauce, but we found that
the thin cutlets overcooked and became dry as they sat while the sauce
simmered. Bucking tradition, we first make the sauce and then dredge and
brown the chicken. Mushrooms, peppers, shallots, garlic, and capers make
for a flavorful sauce, finished with butter for silky texture and
parsley for freshness.
