This green curry takes a creative approach by using oat milk instead of coconut milk, with peanut butter adding richness and body. The result is lighter but deeply satisfying, with bright, spicy, aromatic flavors enhanced by fresh curry leaves. The curry leaves are used twice: simmered into the base for depth, then crisply fried as a fragrant finishing tadka. It's a pantry-friendly Thai-South Asian fusion that works beautifully with whatever vegetables you have on hand.

## Equipment
- Large pot or wok (12-14 inch)
- Small frying pan (for curry leaf tadka)
- Whisk
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Cutting board and knife

## Ingredients

### For the Curry Base
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) neutral oil (vegetable or canola)
- 3 to 4 tablespoons Thai green curry paste (start with 3)
- 8 to 10 fresh curry leaves
- 2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon (15g) fresh ginger, minced
- 2 tablespoons (32g) natural peanut butter
- 1.5 cups (360ml) oat milk
- 1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable stock

### For the Vegetables
- 1 can (400g/14oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 8 oz (225g) white mushrooms, quartered
- 2 medium carrots, sliced into coins or matchsticks
- 2 to 3 stalks bok choy, stems chopped, leaves separated

### For Seasoning
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce (or reduce if using kecap manis)
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce) OR 1 to 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) rice vinegar or fresh lemon juice
- Kosher salt to taste

### For the Curry Leaf Tadka (Finishing Touch)
- 1 to 2 tablespoons (15-30ml) neutral oil
- 10 to 12 fresh curry leaves

### To Serve
- Rice noodles
- Fresh herbs (cilantro, Thai basil, or mint)
- Lemon or lime wedges
- Sliced red chili (optional)

## Instructions

### Build the Curry Base (8 minutes)
1. **Bloom the curry paste**: Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot or wok over medium heat. Add curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and darkened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. The paste should smell intensely aromatic.

2. **Add aromatics and curry leaves**: Add 8 to 10 curry leaves, minced garlic, and ginger to the bloomed paste. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant. The curry leaves will crackle slightly and release their aromatic oils.

3. **Incorporate peanut butter**: Stir in peanut butter and cook until melted and fully incorporated with the curry paste, about 1 minute. This creates the rich, creamy base.

4. **Add liquids**: Pour in oat milk and vegetable stock, whisking to combine everything smoothly. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Don't let it boil vigorously or the oat milk may separate.

### Cook the Vegetables (10 minutes)
5. **Add sturdy vegetables**: Add carrots and mushrooms first, as they take longer to cook. Simmer for 5 to 7 minutes until carrots are tender-crisp and mushrooms have released their liquid.

6. **Add quick-cooking items**: Stir in chickpeas and bok choy stems. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until bok choy stems begin to soften. Add bok choy leaves in the last minute of cooking—they'll wilt quickly.

### Season and Finish (5 minutes)
7. **Season to perfection**: Stir in soy sauce (or reduced amount if using kecap manis), kecap manis (or sugar), and rice vinegar. Taste and adjust:
   - More curry paste for heat and depth
   - More soy sauce or salt for saltiness
   - More kecap manis or sugar for sweetness
   - More vinegar or citrus for brightness
   - Balance should be spicy-sweet-savory-sour

8. **Prepare curry leaf tadka**: While curry simmers, heat 1 to 2 tablespoons oil in a small frying pan over medium-high until shimmering. Add 10 to 12 fresh curry leaves (stand back—they'll crackle and pop vigorously!). Fry for 30 to 60 seconds until crispy and intensely fragrant. Remove from heat immediately.

9. **Cook noodles and serve**: Cook rice noodles according to package directions. Drain and divide among bowls. Ladle curry over noodles. Pour the hot curry leaf tadka (oil and crispy leaves) over each serving. Garnish with fresh herbs, citrus wedges, and sliced chili if using.

## Notes

- **Curry leaves magic**: This recipe uses curry leaves twice for maximum impact. The leaves simmered into the base provide deep, integrated flavor. The crispy fried tadka adds a bright aromatic punch and textural contrast. This dual technique is borrowed from South Indian cooking and transforms the curry.

- **No curry leaves?** The recipe still works beautifully without them. Skip step 2's curry leaves and omit the tadka. The curry will be more purely Thai in character.

- **Oat milk substitute**: The combination of oat milk and peanut butter mimics coconut milk's richness without the heaviness. The peanut butter adds protein, creaminess, and subtle nuttiness that works beautifully with Thai flavors.

- **Kecap manis advantage**: Indonesian sweet soy sauce (kecap manis) adds both sweetness and umami depth, creating a Thai-Indonesian-South Indian fusion. This is the preferred sweetener over plain sugar.

- **Don't overcook the oat milk**: Keep heat at a gentle simmer. Aggressive boiling can cause oat milk to separate or become grainy.

- **Consistency adjustment**: The recipe uses 2 cups total liquid for a thick, coating curry. For a thinner, brothier curry, add more stock 1/4 cup at a time. Remember that mushrooms release additional liquid as they cook.

- **Curry paste strength**: Green curry paste varies wildly between brands. Start with 3 tablespoons and add more to taste. Thai brands like Maesri or Mae Ploy tend to be more potent than Western supermarket versions.

- **Tadka safety**: Curry leaves will splatter when they hit hot oil. Add them carefully and stand back. They're done when they stop sizzling and become crispy.

## Variations

- **Vegetable flexibility**: Swap in what you have: green beans, bell peppers, snap peas, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, or eggplant all work beautifully.

- **Protein additions**: Add cubed tofu (press and pan-fry first), tempeh, or keep it chickpea-based. For non-vegan: add fish sauce instead of some soy sauce, or top with soft-boiled eggs.

- **Coconut milk version**: Use 1 can (400ml) coconut milk instead of oat milk and stock. Omit peanut butter. This creates a richer, more traditional Thai curry.

- **Extra richness**: Add another tablespoon of peanut butter or a splash of toasted sesame oil at the end.

- **Spice level**: Reduce curry paste for milder heat. Add fresh Thai bird's eye chilies or dried chilies to the tadka for more fire.

## Storage

Store curry and noodles separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The curry actually improves overnight as flavors meld. The crispy curry leaves will soften in storage—make a fresh tadka when reheating if desired. Reheat curry gently on the stovetop, adding a splash of stock or water if needed. Cook fresh noodles when serving leftovers for best texture. Not recommended for freezing, as oat milk may separate when thawed.
