This recipe is perfect for a cold winter night. The warm spices of south
France and Spain combine to flavor this slow cooking dish. If you don't
have any spices from a Provençal market, my [Moroccan Seasoning]({{< ref "/recipes/moroccan_seasoning" >}}) recipe is a very solid
stand-in.

This recipe contains no definite quantities; use it as a basic map and
improvise (as I did) to create your own version of this delicious dish.
