This recipe comes from [Popote et Potager](https://www.youtube.com/@popoteetpotager), [BANANA BREAD Recette facile et anti gaspi](https://youtu.be/CCDTuorw1ro). The bread (or cake, depending on your definition) is sweetened only by the bananas and chocolate. The recipe yields a dense, moist bread packed with banana flavor.
