This vegan stir-fry takes inspiration from kering tempeh, a beloved dish at Jakarta's Warteg Gang Mangga. Traditionally made with crispy fried tempeh tossed in bumbu dasar merah (Indonesian red spice paste), this version uses pressed tofu for better supermarket availability. The tofu batons are coated in turmeric-spiced cornstarch and fried until golden and craggy, then glazed with a jammy sauce made from lemongrass, chilies, and coconut milk. Finished with sweet soy sauce (kecap manis) and roasted peanuts, the result is spicy, savory-sweet, and deeply satisfying.

## Equipment
- Large plate
- Paper towels
- Small cutting board or flat surface
- Weights (cans or jars)
- Blender
- 12- to 14-inch wok or 12-inch skillet
- Slotted spoon or spatula

## Ingredients

### For the Tofu
- 14 to 16 ounces (400-450g) firm or extra-firm tofu, drained
- 1/4 cup (30g) cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- Kosher salt and ground black pepper
- 1/3 cup (80ml) neutral oil (vegetable or canola)

### For the Red Chili Paste
- 1/4 cup (60ml) coconut milk
- 1/4 cup (50g) packed light brown sugar
- 3 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
- 2 stalks lemongrass, trimmed to bottom 6 inches, dry outer leaves discarded, chopped
- 3 Fresno chilies, stemmed, seeded, and roughly chopped
- 2 medium shallots, roughly chopped
- 4 makrut lime leaves or 1 tablespoon grated lime zest
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

### For the Stir-Fry
- 1/2 cup (70g) roasted peanuts
- 1 medium shallot, sliced into thin rings
- 2 Fresno chilies, sliced into thin rings
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) fresh lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

### Press the Tofu (1 hour)
1. **Set up tofu press**: Line a large plate with a double layer of paper towels. Place tofu on the towels and cover with additional paper towels. Top with a small cutting board or flat surface, then place cans or jars on top to weigh it down. Let stand for 1 hour to remove excess moisture.

### Prepare the Red Chili Paste (5 minutes)
2. **Blend the paste**: While tofu presses, combine coconut milk, brown sugar, garlic, lemongrass, the 3 chopped chilies, 2 chopped shallots, lime leaves (or zest), 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a blender. Process until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Set aside.

### Prepare and Fry the Tofu (15 minutes)
3. **Cut and coat tofu**: Uncover the pressed tofu and transfer to a cutting board. Cut the block into 1/2-inch-thick planks, then stack a few planks and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch batons. In a wide, shallow dish, combine cornstarch, turmeric, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Add tofu batons and toss until evenly coated.

4. **Fry until crispy**: Heat oil in a 12- to 14-inch wok or 12-inch skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add tofu in an even layer and cook without stirring until it releases easily from the pan, about 3 minutes. Toss and continue cooking, stirring intermittently, until crisp and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon. Pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon oil.

### Finish the Stir-Fry (5 minutes)
5. **Cook peanuts and aromatics**: Return the pan to medium-high heat. Add peanuts, sliced shallot, and sliced chilies. Cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to another plate.

6. **Make the glaze**: Add the red chili paste to the empty pan. Cook, stirring constantly, until thick and jammy, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in lime juice, kecap manis, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.

7. **Combine and caramelize**: Return tofu and peanut mixture to the pan. Stir to coat, then cook without stirring until tofu caramelizes in spots, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir once more to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper.

8. **Serve**: Transfer to a serving dish and serve immediately with lime wedges.

## Notes

- **Press the tofu thoroughly**: Don't skip this step. Removing excess moisture makes the tofu sturdier, meatier, and better able to withstand stir-frying. Use the hour it sits under weights to prep other ingredients.
- **Kecap manis substitute**: If you can't find kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce), make an approximation by stirring together 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon molasses, and 1 tablespoon light brown sugar. Use this mixture in place of the 2 tablespoons kecap manis.
- **Lemongrass prep**: Trim to the bottom 6 inches (the tender part), remove the tough outer layers, and chop before blending.
- **Makrut lime leaves**: Also called kaffir lime leaves, these add authentic citrus aroma. Find them fresh or frozen at Asian markets. Lime zest works as a substitute but won't provide the same depth.
- **Heat level**: This dish is moderately spicy. Reduce to 2 Fresno chilies total (1 chopped, 1 sliced) for milder heat, or add Thai bird's eye chilies for more fire.
- **Oil temperature**: The oil should shimmer but not smoke. If tofu browns too quickly, reduce heat slightly.

## Variations

- **Traditional tempeh version**: Substitute 8 ounces tempeh for the tofu. Cut into 1/2-inch cubes and skip the pressing step. Fry as directed.
- **Cashew substitute**: Use roasted cashews instead of peanuts for a milder, creamier result.
- **Vegetable additions**: Add 1 cup green beans or snap peas with the peanuts for extra vegetables.
- **Serve over rice**: This pairs beautifully with steamed jasmine rice or coconut rice.

## Storage

Best served immediately while tofu is crispy. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat in a hot skillet to restore some crispness, though tofu will soften. Not recommended for freezing.
