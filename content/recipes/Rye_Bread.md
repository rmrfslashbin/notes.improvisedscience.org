-   255 grams (2 cups) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
-   160 grams (1¼ cup) rye flour
-   1 egg white, for brushing

## Instructions

### Yeast

-   In a large bowl, sprinkle **yeast** over ¼ cup of **warm water**.
-   Add in **½ tablespoon molasses** and whisk until the yeast
    dissolves.
-   Let the mixture stand for about **5 minutes**, until foamy.

After 5 minutes...

-   Add in and mix to combine:
    -   Remaining water
    -   Molasses
    -   Melted butter
    -   Caraway seeds
    -   Salt

### Combine with flours and first rise

-   Gradually add in **rye** and **all-purpose** flours, one cup at a
    time, until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl and
    forms a sticky ball (add more warm water if too dry).
-   Knead the dough on a floured surface for about **5 minutes**.
-   Shape into a ball and transfer to a large buttered/oiled bowl.
-   Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set in a warm place to rise for
    about **1 hour**, or until **doubled in size**.

### Prepare loaf pan and second rise

-   Butter a 4-1/2 x 8-1/2 inch loaf pan and set aside.
-   When the dough has risen, **punch it down** and on a lightly floured
    surface
-   Roll the dough into a 7 x 7-inch square, then fold it into thirds,
    and pinch the ends to seal.
-   Place the dough, seam-side-down, in the loaf pan and brush with egg
    white.
-   Sprinkle the top of the dough with caraway seeds.
-   Spray a piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray and place it on top
    of the dough.
-   Let stand for **45 minutes to 1 hour**, until the dough touches the
    plastic wrap.

### Bake

-   Preheat oven to **450° F**.
-   Once heated to 450° F, reduce temperature to **400° F**.
-   Remove plastic wrap from loaf pan, place in oven, and bake for
    **45-55 minutes**, rotating the pan halfway through baking, until
    the top is golden brown.
-   Turn out bread onto a cooling rack.
-   Let cool a least **30 minutes** before slicing.
