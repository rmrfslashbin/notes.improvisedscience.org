This vegan interpretation of the Sichuan classic mapo tofu uses tender green lentils instead of tofu or ground pork. The lentils provide a hearty, meaty texture while absorbing the bold, complex flavors of fermented doubanjiang (broad bean chili paste) and numbing Sichuan peppercorns. The dish achieves the hallmark má là (numbing-spicy) sensation with layers of heat from chili oil and a tingling, almost electric numbness from the peppercorns. Deeply savory, richly spiced, and absolutely addictive served over steamed rice.

## Equipment
- Medium saucepan (for cooking lentils)
- Large wok or deep skillet (12-14 inch)
- Small dry skillet (for toasting peppercorns)
- Spice grinder or mortar and pestle
- Fine-mesh strainer

## Ingredients

### For the Lentils
- 1 cup (200g) dried green lentils (French lentils du Puy work well)
- 3 cups (720ml) water or vegetable stock
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

### For the Sichuan Peppercorn Mixture
- 2 tablespoons whole Sichuan peppercorns
- 3 tablespoons (45ml) neutral oil

### For the Aromatics and Sauce
- 3 tablespoons (45ml) neutral oil (vegetable or canola)
- 3 tablespoons (45g) doubanjiang (fermented broad bean chili paste)
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) chili oil (with sediment) OR 1 tablespoon neutral oil + 1 tablespoon chili flakes
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons (30g) fresh ginger, minced
- 4 scallions, white and light green parts minced, dark green parts sliced for garnish (keep separate)
- 1 cup (240ml) vegetable stock
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) Chinese black vinegar or rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon (8g) cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons (30ml) water (slurry)

### To Serve
- Steamed white rice or brown rice
- Reserved scallion greens, sliced
- Cilantro leaves (optional)
- Extra chili oil for drizzling

## Instructions

### Cook the Lentils (25 minutes)
1. **Simmer the lentils**: Rinse lentils in a fine-mesh strainer. Combine lentils, water (or stock), and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes until tender but still hold their shape. They should have a slight bite, not be mushy. Drain and set aside.

### Prepare the Sichuan Peppercorn Oil (5 minutes)
2. **Toast the peppercorns**: While lentils cook, toast Sichuan peppercorns in a small dry skillet over medium heat, shaking frequently, until fragrant and lightly smoking, 2 to 3 minutes. Don't let them burn. Transfer to a plate to cool.

3. **Grind peppercorns**: Once cooled, grind half the peppercorns (1 tablespoon) to a coarse powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Reserve the remaining whole peppercorns for the oil.

4. **Make peppercorn oil**: Heat 3 tablespoons neutral oil in a small saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Add the whole toasted peppercorns and fry gently for 2 to 3 minutes until the oil is fragrant and the peppercorns darken slightly. Remove from heat and let steep while you prepare the dish. Strain before using if desired, or leave peppercorns in for more intense flavor.

### Build the Mapo Sauce (10 minutes)
5. **Fry the doubanjiang**: Heat 3 tablespoons neutral oil in a large wok or deep skillet over medium heat. Add doubanjiang and chili oil (or oil + chili flakes). Fry, stirring constantly, until the paste darkens and becomes deeply fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. The oil should turn a brilliant red. This step is crucial for developing flavor—don't rush it.

6. **Add aromatics**: Add garlic, ginger, and minced scallion whites/light greens to the wok. Stir-fry for 1 minute until fragrant but not browned.

7. **Build the sauce**: Pour in vegetable stock, soy sauce, black vinegar, and sugar. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Let it bubble for 2 to 3 minutes to meld the flavors.

### Finish the Dish (5 minutes)
8. **Add lentils**: Add the cooked, drained lentils to the sauce. Stir gently to coat the lentils in the sauce. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, allowing the lentils to absorb the flavors.

9. **Thicken**: Stir the cornstarch slurry to recombine, then pour into the wok while stirring. The sauce will thicken immediately and become glossy. Cook for 1 minute more.

10. **Add Sichuan peppercorn flavor**: Stir in about half the ground Sichuan peppercorn powder and drizzle in 1 to 2 tablespoons of the Sichuan peppercorn oil. Taste—the dish should have a noticeable tingling, numbing sensation (má) along with the heat (là).

11. **Serve**: Transfer to a serving dish. Drizzle with more peppercorn oil, sprinkle with remaining ground peppercorn powder, garnish with sliced scallion greens and cilantro if using. Serve immediately over steamed rice with extra chili oil on the side.

## Notes

- **Má là explained**: Sichuan cuisine is known for má là—"numbing-spicy." The má (numbing) comes from Sichuan peppercorns, which contain hydroxy-alpha-sanshool that creates a tingling, electric sensation. The là (spicy) comes from chili peppers. Both work together to create the signature flavor profile.

- **Doubanjiang is essential**: This fermented broad bean and chili paste is the soul of mapo dishes. Brands like Pixian doubanjiang are considered the gold standard. Look for it in Asian grocery stores. It's deeply savory, funky, and spicy—no substitute captures its complexity.

- **Toast peppercorns fresh**: Sichuan peppercorns lose potency quickly. Always toast them just before using to release their aromatic oils. Pre-ground peppercorns lack the intensity you need.

- **Lentil texture matters**: Cook lentils until tender but still intact. They should hold their shape and have a slight firmness. Mushy lentils won't provide the right texture contrast.

- **Adjust numbing level**: Start with half the ground peppercorn powder and peppercorn oil, then add more to taste. The numbing sensation can be intense for those not accustomed to it. You can always add more but can't take it away.

- **Chili oil quality**: Use Chinese chili oil with sediment (the settled chili flakes). The sediment contains concentrated flavor and adds texture. Lao Gan Ma (老干妈) is a widely available brand.

- **Black vinegar substitute**: Chinese black vinegar (Chinkiang vinegar) adds a mellow, slightly sweet acidity. If unavailable, use rice vinegar or a mix of rice vinegar and a tiny splash of balsamic.

- **Make it traditional**: For a non-vegan version, use chicken stock and add 8 oz ground pork or crumbled firm tofu along with the lentils.

## Variations

- **With silken tofu**: Add 8 oz cubed silken tofu in the last 2 minutes of cooking for the traditional mapo texture alongside the lentils.

- **Extra vegetables**: Stir in blanched bok choy, spinach, or peas in the last minute for added greens.

- **Ground mushroom version**: Pulse 8 oz mushrooms in a food processor until finely chopped. Fry with the doubanjiang before adding lentils for extra umami and meaty texture.

- **Serving suggestions**: Serve over rice noodles, wheat noodles, or even crispy fried rice for different textures.

- **Heat control**: Reduce doubanjiang to 2 tablespoons and omit chili oil for a milder version. The dish will still have the numbing sensation but less heat.

## Storage

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. The flavors actually deepen and improve after a day. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a splash of stock or water if needed. The lentils will continue to absorb liquid, so expect to thin the sauce slightly when reheating. The numbing sensation from Sichuan peppercorns fades over time, so consider adding a fresh sprinkle of ground peppercorns when serving leftovers. Freezes well for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.
