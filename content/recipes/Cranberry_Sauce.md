This is a tart rendition of a classic cranberry sauce. Some recipes
indicate using a minimum of 6 tablespoons of sugar per 4 cups of
cranberries, others indicate as much as a cup of sugar. Sweeten as
desired to accomidate invididual tastes. Just remember: you can always
add sugar, but you can't take it out.

## Ingredients

-   4 cups whole cranberries
-   1 cups water
-   4 tablespoons sugar
-   Pinch of salt
-   Â¼ cup orange juice or Grand Marnier (optional)

## Preparation

-   In a medium saucepan, combine:
    -   cranberries
    -   water
    -   sugar
    -   salt
-   Let the sauce boil until it thickens; the water will evaporate and
    the pectin in the cranberries will be activated as it cooks.
-   Let it boil for at least 10 minutes, and up to 25 minutes.
-   Remove from heat.
-   Stir in juice or liqueur, if using.
-   Serve or then cover sauce and chill.
