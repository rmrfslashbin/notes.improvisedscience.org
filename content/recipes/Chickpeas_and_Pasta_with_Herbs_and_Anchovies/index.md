## Ingredients

### Pasta and Base
- 450g (1 pound) cavatelli, orecchiette, or ditalini pasta
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 60ml (¼ cup) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving

### Flavor Components
- 8-10 oil-packed anchovy fillets, roughly chopped (or vegetarian substitute - see notes)
- 4 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 30ml (2 tablespoons) chopped fresh sage
- 30ml (2 tablespoons) minced fresh rosemary

### Chickpeas
- Two 440g (15½-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained
- 120ml (½ cup) reserved chickpea liquid (aquafaba)

### Finishing
- 1-2ml (¼ to ½ teaspoon) red pepper flakes
- 10ml (2 teaspoons) grated lemon zest
- 30ml (2 tablespoons) fresh lemon juice

## Equipment
- Large pot for pasta
- 12-inch skillet
- Wooden spoon or pasta fork
- Fine grater for lemon zest

## Instructions

### Stage 1: Cook the Pasta (10 minutes)
1. Bring 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a large pot
2. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt
3. Cook, stirring occasionally, until just shy of al dente (about 1 minute less than package directions)
4. Reserve ¾ cup of the pasta cooking water
5. Drain pasta and return to pot; set aside off heat

### Stage 2: Build the Sauce (5 minutes)
1. Heat ¼ cup olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat
2. Add anchovies (or substitute), garlic, sage, and rosemary
3. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and garlic turns golden (1½ to 2 minutes)
4. Add drained chickpeas and red pepper flakes
5. Cook, stirring and swirling the skillet, until chickpeas are sizzling and turn golden (3 to 4 minutes)
6. Stir in reserved chickpea liquid and lemon zest

### Stage 3: Combine and Finish (5 minutes)
1. Scrape the entire chickpea mixture into the pot with the pasta
2. Set pot over medium heat
3. Add ½ cup reserved pasta water, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon black pepper
4. Cook, stirring constantly, until pasta reaches al dente (2 to 3 minutes)
5. Add more pasta water as needed until sauce clings to pasta
6. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice
7. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt

## Notes

### Vegetarian Anchovy Substitutes
- **White or red miso paste** (2-3 tablespoons) - provides similar umami depth
- **Capers** (2-3 tablespoons, chopped) - adds brininess and tang
- **Kalamata or oil-cured olives** (¼ cup, chopped) - brings saltiness and complexity
- **Nutritional yeast** (2-3 tablespoons) - offers umami and slight nuttiness
- **Mushroom powder or dried porcini** (1-2 tablespoons, rehydrated) - deep earthy umami
- **Soy sauce or tamari** (1-2 tablespoons) - liquid umami boost
- **Sun-dried tomatoes in oil** (¼ cup, chopped) - concentrated savory flavor
- **Combination approach**: 1 tablespoon miso + 1 tablespoon capers + splash of soy sauce

### Make-Ahead Tips
- Chickpea mixture can be prepared up to Stage 2 and refrigerated for up to 2 days
- Reheat gently before combining with freshly cooked pasta

### Variations
- Add a handful of baby spinach or arugula at the end for greens
- Include halved cherry tomatoes for freshness
- Top with toasted breadcrumbs for texture
- Use butter beans or cannellini beans instead of chickpeas

### Storage
- Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days
- Reheat gently with a splash of water or olive oil to loosen the sauce
- Not recommended for freezing as pasta texture will suffer
