A fantastic pie which is fairly easy to make; albeit somewhat
time-consuming. My changes to the recipe yield a tarter and naturally
flavored pie. The crumble topping can be swapped for a traditional
crust. If so desired, make full batch of [Pâte Brisée](/recipes/pate_brisee).

## Ingredients

### Filling

-   About 900 to 1000 grams (about 2 pounds) apples, peeled, cored and
    sliced ¼-inch thick. Granny Smith and/or Honey Crisp.
-   1 Tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
-   25 grams (1/8 cup) light brown sugar, packed
-   25 grams (1/8 cup) granulated sugar
-   ½ to 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
-   ¼ teaspoon nutmeg, preferably fresh grated
-   ¼ teaspoon salt
-   30 grams (2 Tablespoons) unsalted butter
-   2 tablespoons good Bourbon
-   1 Tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch
-   1 heaping cup fresh cranberries

### Crumble

-   65 grams (½ cup) all-purpose flour
-   75 grams (1/3 cup) packed light brown sugar
-   1/3 cup old-fashioned oats
-   ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
-   ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
-   1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
-   ¼ teaspoon salt
-   55 grams (4 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
-   ¼ cup coarsely chopped salted pistachios

## Preparation

### Crust

-   Prepare half a recipe of [Pâte Brisée](/recipes/pate_brisee) (for the
    bottom crust).
-   On a lightly floured surface, roll dough out into a 13-inch round.
-   Gently lift the 13-inch round from the floured surface and center in
    a deep 9-inch round pie dish.
-   Place in the fridge to chill while you prepare the filling.

### Filling

#### Apples

-   In a large bowl, combine and toss to mix:
    -   Apples
    -   Lemon juice
    -   Brown sugar
    -   Granulated sugar
    -   Cinnamon
    -   Nutmeg
    -   Salt
-   Place the apples in a fine mesh strainer set over the large bowl.
-   Allow the apples to
    [macerate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maceration_%28food%29) at
    room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of 3
    hours. The mixture will release at least ½ cup of liquid.
-   Transfer the apples and cranberries to a bowl and toss them with the
    cornstarch until all traces of the cornstarch have disappeared.

#### Syrup

-   In a small saucepan, combine:
    -   Apple liquid
    -   Butter
    -   Bourbon
-   Boil to reduce the liquid to about 1/3 cup, or until syrupy and
    lightly caramelized.

#### Combine

-   Pour the syrup over the apples, tossing gently (Do not be concerned
    if the liquid hardens on contact with the apples and cranberries; it
    will dissolve during baking.)
-   Transfer the apple and cranberry mixture to the pie shell.

### Crumble

-   In a medium bowl, whisk together:
    -   Flour
    -   Sugar
    -   Oats
    -   Spices
    -   Salt
-   Add the butter and toss the mixture together with your hands.
-   Break the butter up into the flour mixture until the butter is the
    size of small pebbles and oat flakes.
-   Toss in the pistachios.
-   Sprinkle the crumble over the apple and cranberry mixture. The
    apples should be completely covered with crumble mixture to prevent
    burning.

### Bake Pie

-   Place pie on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 1 hour, until the
    edges bubble and the apples are cooked through.
-   Allow to cool for at least an hour before serving.
