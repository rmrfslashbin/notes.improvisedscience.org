"Chocolate chip cookies for grown-ups". Toasted rye paired with browned

deeply rich and addictive cookie. The entire recipe can be completed by
hand; no need for a stand mixer.

## Change Log

-   Reduced chocolate chunks
-   Swapped tart dried cherries for nuts

## Notes

### Brown Butter

To brown butter, simple place butter (cold or room temperature) in a
7-inch non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Once the butter melts,
gently stir every few minutes. The butter will start to separate and the
solids will start to brown. Note the nutty aroma. Once the sound of
popping and sizzling subsides, the butter will be browned. Be careful to
not cook the butter any longer as it can burn.

### Rotating cookie sheets

Begin by baking the first batch on a room temperature parchment lined
cookie sheet. While the first batch is backing, prep the second sheet.
Once the first batch is baked, slide the parchment and cookies off the
hot sheet and onto a cool surface (such as a marble counter-top or wire
cooling rack). Bake the second batch. Allow the first sheet to cool to
room temperature; then prep for the third batch. Continue this process
until all cookies are backed.

By following this process, each batch of cookies will be baked on a room
temperature cookie sheet and should thus require the same baking time.

## Special Equipment

-   Two cookie sheets
-   Parchment paper
-   12" skillet (to toast rye)
-   7" skillet (to brown butter)

## Preheat Oven

-   Preheat oven to 350°
-   Position rack to middle position

## Ingredients

-   142 grams (1 cup) all-purpose flour
-   7 grams (1.128 teaspoon) salt
-   3 grams (½ teaspoon) baking soda
-   140 grams (1 cup) rye flour
-   170 grams (12 tablespoons or 1½ sticks) unsalted butter
-   248 grams (1¼ cups) white sugar
-   2 large eggs
-   1 tablespoon molasses
-   1 tablespoon vanilla extract
-   100 grams (about 1 cup) dark chocolate chips or chopped bittersweet
    chocolate
-   100 grams (¾ cup) dried tart cherries

## Preparation

### Combine Dry Ingredients

-   In a medium bowl, whisk together:
    -   All-­purpose flour
    -   Salt
    -   Baking soda

### Toast Rye and Brown Butter

-   In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, toast the rye flour until
    fragrant and a shade or two darker, about 5 minutes, stirring
    frequently.
-   At the same time, brown the butter in a 7-inch skillet over
    medium-low heat.
-   Remove the skillet with the rye from heat; add the browned butter
    and stir until combined.
-   Refrigerate the mixture if needed to cool to room temp.

### Cream

Once the rye mixture is cool...

-   In a large bowl, mix together:
    -   Sugar
    -   Eggs
    -   Molasses
    -   Vanilla
-   Slowly stir rye mixture into the creamed egg mixture

### Add Dry

-   Add the dry ingredients to the cream/rye mixture and stir until
    combined.
-   Stir in the chocolate chips and dried cherries (if using).

### Bake

If the dough is too soft to manage, refrigerate about 30 to 45 minutes.
Place dough in the refrigerator in between batches to keep cool.

-   Drop 2-tablespoon mounds of dough about 2 inches apart on the
    prepared baking sheets.
-   One sheet at a time, bake until the edges are firm and the centers
    are soft, **8 to 12 minutes**, rotating the sheet halfway through.
-   Cool on the sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and
    cool for 10 minutes.
-   Repeat with the second sheet.
