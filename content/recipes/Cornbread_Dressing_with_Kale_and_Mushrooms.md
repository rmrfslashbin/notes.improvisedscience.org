I've heavily modified the source recipe to drop the raisins and swap the
sourdough for cornbread.

## Source

Inspired by
<http://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/8529-sourdough-dressing-with-kale-and-mushrooms>

## Notes

-   To make ahead: Dressing can be made up till baking (noted below) and
    refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Increase covered baking time by 5
    minutes.

## Special Equipment

-   13 by 9-inch baking dish

## Preheat Oven

-   Preheat oven to 400°F

## Ingredients

-   680 grams (1.5 lbs) 1.5x recipe of [Corn Bread](/recipes/Corn_bread.md)
-   3 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter
-   ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
-   Salt and pepper
-   340 grams (12 ounces) shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced 1/4
    inch thick
-   230 grams (8 ounces) kale, stemmed and chopped coarse
-   1 onion, chopped
-   5 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
-   2 tablespoons minced fresh sage

## Preparation

### Prep Foil, Oven Racks, and Pans

-   Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and
    heat oven to 400 degrees.

-   Grease a 15 by 11-inch sheet of aluminum foil with ½ tablespoon
    butter.

### Combine Cornbread

-   Toss together in a large bowl then spread evenly on rimmed baking
    sheet:
    -   Cornbread

    baking sheet:

    -   Onion

    -   Sage
    -   Remaining ¼ cup oil

-   Break **sausage** into ½-inch pieces and distribute evenly over
    **vegetables**.

### Bake Bread & Vegetables

-   Bake bread mixture on upper rack and vegetable mixture on lower rack
    until bread is golden brown but still tender inside and vegetables
    and sausage are golden, about 30 minutes, stirring halfway through
    baking.
-   Transfer sheets to wire racks and let cool slightly, about 10
    minutes.

### Combine Dressing

-   Combine toasted **bread** and **vegetable mixture** in large bowl.
-   Stir **broth** and **eggs** into bread-vegetable mixture until
    liquid is absorbed.

**If making ahead, stop here, cover bowl and refrigerate up to 24
hours.**

    sprinkle evenly over dressing.
-   Cover tightly with prepared foil.

### Bake Dressing

    minutes longer.
