## Method

### Crust

-   Adjust oven rack to **middle position** and preheat oven to
    **350°F**.
-   Whisk together:
    -   flour
    -   sugar
    -   salt
-   Add **olive oil** and **water**; stir until a uniform dough forms.

    the bottom of the **tart pan**.
-   Using your fingers, press the dough to an even thickness over the
    bottom of the pan.
-   Crumble **remaining dough** and press into **fluted sides** of pan.
-   Place tart pan on a **rimmed baking sheet** and then bake until
    crust is **deep golden brown**' and **firm to touch**, about **30 to
    25 minutes**, **rotating half-way** through baking.
-   Remove from oven.

### Filling

**10 minutes before crust is finished baking**...

-   Whisk together in a **medium saucepan**:
    -   sugar
    -   flour
    -   salt
-   Whisk in **eggs** and **yolks** until no streaks of egg remain.
-   Whisk in **lemon zest** and **lemon juice**.

    corners of the saucepan until mixture registers **160°F**, about **5
    to 8 minutes**.

### Combine, Strain, and Bake

-   Off heat, whisk in **olive oil** until incorporated.
-   Strain curd though a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl.
-   Pour strained curd into warm tart shell.
-   Bake until filling is set and barely jiggles when pan is shaken,
    about **8 to 12 minutes**.

### Cool

-   Remove tart from oven and cool on a wire rack at least **2 hours**.
-   Move tart to refrigerator and chill until firm, about **1 hour**.
-   Remove outer tart-pan ring.

    slide tart onto a serving platter.
