This simple yeasted flatbread combines nutty spelt flour with all-purpose flour for a wholesome, versatile bread that's cooked directly on the stovetop. The addition of yogurt creates a tender crumb while oat milk keeps the recipe dairy-free friendly. These flatbreads puff beautifully when cooked and are perfect for wrapping, dipping, or serving alongside your favorite meals.

## Ingredients

### For the Dough
- **500g flour blend** (250g spelt flour, 250g all-purpose flour)
- **30ml neutral oil** (2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon), divided
- **60ml whole-milk yogurt** (4 tablespoons)
- **7g active dried yeast** (1 packet)
- **10g sugar** (2 teaspoons)
- **12g kosher salt** (2 teaspoons)
- **5g baking powder** (1 level teaspoon)
- **240ml oat milk**, warmed

## Equipment
- Large mixing bowl
- Clean dish towel
- Well-floured cutting board
- Rolling pin
- Large sauté pan or cast iron skillet
- Spatula

## Instructions

### Making the Dough
1. **Combine dry ingredients** (5 minutes): Place the spelt and all-purpose flours in a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Create a well in the center and add 2 tablespoons of oil, yogurt, yeast, sugar, salt, and baking powder.

2. **Form the dough** (5 minutes): Using your fingers, mix the center ingredients until they resemble coarse crumbs. Gradually add the warm oat milk in splashes, mixing after each addition until a shaggy dough forms.

### First Rise
3. **Knead and proof** (5 minutes active, 60-90 minutes rising): Transfer the sticky dough to a well-floured cutting board. With floured hands, knead for 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Form into a ball, rub with 1 teaspoon oil, and place in a clean bowl. Cover with a dish towel and let rise in a warm spot for 60-90 minutes, until doubled in size.

### Shaping
4. **Divide and shape** (10 minutes): Using a knife or bench scraper, divide the dough into 12 equal pieces (about 65g each). Roll each piece into a ball, then flatten between your palms. Dust with flour and roll each into an oval approximately 5 by 8 inches (13 by 20 cm).

### Cooking
5. **Cook the flatbreads** (10-15 minutes total): Heat a large sauté pan or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Cook one flatbread for 30-40 seconds until bubbles form on the surface. Flip and cook the second side for 30-40 seconds. Flip once more, pressing gently with a spatula for 10-15 seconds to encourage puffing. Transfer to a warm platter and repeat with remaining dough.

## Notes
- **Flour blend**: The 50/50 spelt and all-purpose flour combination provides whole grain nutrition with good gluten development for a soft, pliable flatbread
- **Oat milk temperature**: Warm the oat milk to about 105-110°F (40-43°C) - it should feel comfortably warm to the touch, not hot
- **Keep warm**: Stack finished flatbreads and wrap in foil or keep in a low oven (170°F/75°C) until ready to serve
- **Pan temperature**: The pan should be hot enough that a drop of water sizzles immediately on contact

## Variations
- **Herb flatbread**: Add 2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, or oregano) to the dough
- **Seeded flatbread**: Sprinkle with sesame seeds, nigella seeds, or za'atar before the final flip
- **Garlic butter finish**: Brush with garlic-infused olive oil or butter while still warm
- **100% whole grain**: Use all spelt flour for a heartier, denser flatbread

## Storage
- **Room temperature**: Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days
- **Refrigerator**: Wrap well and refrigerate for up to 5 days
- **Freezer**: Layer between parchment paper and freeze for up to 3 months
- **Reheating**: Wrap in damp paper towel and microwave for 20-30 seconds, or warm in a dry skillet over medium heat
