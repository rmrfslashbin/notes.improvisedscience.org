> This is a flavorful pastry dough that is quick to make and easy to

> over mix this dough or it will be tough after baking. Pâte Brisée is
> pronounced paht bree-ZAY. It is a French short crust pastry dough made
> from a mixture of flour, a little sugar, salt, butter, and ice water.
> It has a high ratio of fat to flour which gives the pastry its crumbly

## Special Equipment

-   Food Processor

## Ingredients (Full Recipe)

Use the full recipe measurements for two 9-inch crusts.

-   2 ½ cups (350 grams) all-purpose flour
-   1 teaspoon (4 grams) salt
-   1 tablespoon (14 grams) granulated white sugar
-   1 cup (2 sticks) (226 grams) unsalted butter, chilled, and cut into
    1 inch (2.54 cm) pieces
-   ¼ to ½ cup (60 - 120 ml) ice water

## Ingredients (Half Recipe)

Use the half recipe measurements for one 9-inch crusts.

-   1 ¼ cups (175 grams) all-purpose flour
-   ½ teaspoon (2 grams) salt
-   ½ tablespoon (7 grams) granulated white sugar
-   ½ cup (1 sticks) (113 grams) unsalted butter, chilled, and cut into
    1 inch (2.54 cm) pieces
-   ¼ to ½ cup (60 - 120 ml) ice water

## Preparation

-   In a food processor, process until combined:
    -   flour
    -   salt
    -   sugar
-   Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal
    (about 15 seconds).
-   Pour ¼ cup (60 ml) water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed
    tube until the dough just holds together when pinched.
-   Add remaining water, if necessary.

**Do not process more than 30 seconds.**

-   Turn the dough out onto your work surface and gather it into a ball.
-   Divide the dough into two equal pieces, flatten each portion into a
    disk.
-   Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to one hour
    before using.

This will chill the butter and allow the gluten in the flour to relax.
At this point you can also freeze the dough for later use.

## Process

For each disk of pastry, on a lightly floured surface, roll out the
pastry to fit into a 8 or 9 inch (20 to 23 cm) tart pan. To prevent the
pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness,
keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll
(always roll from the center of the pastry outwards to get uniform
thickness). To make sure it is the right size, take your tart pan, flip
it over, and place it on the rolled out pastry. The pastry should be
about an inch larger than your pan.

When the pastry is rolled to the desired size, lightly roll pastry
around your rolling pin, dusting off any excess flour as you roll.
Unroll onto the top of your tart pan. Never pull the pastry or you will
get shrinkage (shrinkage is caused by too much pulling of the pastry
when placing it in the pan). Gently lay in pan and with a small floured
piece of pastry, lightly press pastry into bottom and up sides of pan.
Roll your rolling pin over top of pan to get rid of excess pastry. With
a thumb up movement, again press dough into pan. Roll rolling pin over
top again to get rid of any extra pastry. Prick bottom of dough (this
will prevent the dough from puffing up as it bakes). Cover and
refrigerate for 20 minutes to chill the butter and to rest the gluten.

## Prebake

To prebake the tart shell: Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C) and place rack
in center of oven. Line the unbaked pastry shell with parchment paper or
aluminum foil. Fill tart pan with pie weights or beans, making sure the
weights are to the top of the pan and evenly distributed over the entire
surface. Bake crust for 20 to 25 minutes or until the crust is dry and
lightly browned. Remove weights and cool crust on wire rack. Proceed
with desired recipe that calls for a pre-baked shell.
