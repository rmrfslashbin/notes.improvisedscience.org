-   1 cup (240 ml) milk

## Preparation

### Prepare Cake Pans

-   Butter two 9" round cake pans.
-   Cut to fit a single sheet of parchment for each of the rounds; affix
    to the inside bottom of buttered pans.
-   Butter the parchment.
-   Lightly flour; shake out any loose residue.

### Melt Chocolate

-   In a heatproof bowl, combine chopped unsweetened chocolate and cocoa
    powder.
-   Add 1 cup boiling water.

-   Set aside; cool to room temperature.

### Combine Dry Ingredients

In a medium sized bowl, sift or whisk together:

-   Flour
-   Baking powder
-   Baking soda
-   Salt

### Using Stand Mixer

Use a stand mixer, on mostly medium speed, to beat butter, sugar, and
eggs. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.

-   Using a stand mixer, beat butter until smooth.
-   While continuing to beat, gradually add sugar; beat till fluffy-
    about 3 minutes.
-   Add eggs, one at a time; mix well after each addition.
-   Add vanilla.
-   Add cooled chocolate mixture; beat till combined.

### Add Dry Ingredients and Milk

With stand mixer set to low/stir, add the dry ingredients and milk in
alternating additions; just till combined. Begin and end with dry
ingredients:

-   1/3 dry
-   ½ milk
-   1/3 dry
-   ½ milk
-   1/3 dry

## Divide Batter and Bake

-   Evenly divide batter into prepared cake pans.
-   Bake 35 to 40 minutes.
-   Test for done-ness: toothpick inserted onto the middle should come
    out clean.

-   Turn out cakes onto wire rack, remove parchment, and cool
    completely.
