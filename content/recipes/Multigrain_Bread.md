This recipe has been tested and tweaked over time. Most of the
modifications (so far) are to simplify the process.

For each rise, the dough should be kept in a warm area, covered with
plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. If a suitably warm place is not
available (cold season, air conditioned house, etc), use a conventional
gas oven: turn on the oven; as soon as the element fires up, turn off
the oven. This will provide a suitably warm environment for the dough to
properly rise.

This recipe will make either: two loaf or one boule.

## Cook & Prep Time

Total prep and cooking time is estimated at about 240 minutes (4 hours).
This does not include cool down time of 2 hours.

## Special Equipment

-   Two 9×5" loaf pans; coat with butter or olive oil -- or --
-   Baking stone, if making a boule.
-   Stand mixer with dough hook (or clean counter top to hand kneed).
-   Cooling rack.

## Ingredients

### Step 1

-   180 grams (1 ¼ cup) seven-grain hot cereal mix
-   2 ½ cups boiling water

### Step 2

-   425 grams (3 cups) all-purpose flour (not bread flour)
-   235 grams (1 ½ cups) whole wheat flour --or-- substitute equal
    amounts of other glutenous grain (rye, spelt, barley, etc).
-   3 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast

### Step 3

-   80 grams (¼ cup) honey --or-- molasses, depending on the desired
    flavor profile.
-   60 grams (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and cooled

### Step 4

-   17 grams (1 tablespoon) salt

## Preparation

### Hydrate Cereal

**60 minutes**

-   Place cereal in bowl of stand mixer fitted with dough hook and add
    boiling water; stir.
-   Let stand, stirring occasionally, until mixture cools to 37°C
    (100°F) and resembles thick porridge, about 1 hour.

### Combine

-   While cereal is cooling, whisk together flours and yeast in a
    separate bowl.
-   Once cereal mixture has cooled, add and mix on low speed till
    combined:
    -   Honey
    -   Butter
-   Add flour/yeast mixture, ½ cup at a time; knead until cohesive mass
    starts to form.

### 1st kneed & rest

**25 minutes**

-   Continue kneading for 1 to 1 ½ minutes.
-   Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap
-   Let dough rest for 20 minutes.

### 2nd kneed & rest

**70 minutes**

-   Add salt and knead on medium-low speed until dough clears sides of
    bowl, 3-4 minutes
-   Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead by hand until
    seeds are dispersed evenly and dough forms smooth, round ball (about
    12 minutes).
-   Place dough in large, lightly greased bowl
-   Cover tightly with plastic and let rise at room temperature until
    nearly doubled in size, 45-60 minutes.

### 3rd kneed, rest, and pans

**40 minutes**

#### Loaf Pans

If baking in loaf pans:

-   Oil two loaf pans.
-   Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and divide in half.
-   Press 1 piece of dough into 9×6 inch rectangle, with short side
    facing you.
-   Roll dough toward you into firm cylinder, keeping roll taut by
    tucking it under itself as you go.
-   Turn loaf seam side up and pinch it closed.
-   Repeat with second piece of dough.
-   Cover loaves loosely with greased plastic and let until nearly
    doubled in size 30-40 minutes.
-   Dough should barely spring back when poked with knuckle.

#### Boule

If baking the bread as a boule:

-   Simply punch down the loaf and cover
-   Let rise until nearly doubled in size 30-40 minutes.
-   Dough should barely spring back when poked with knuckle.

### Bake

**40 minutes**

#### Loaf Pans

If baking in loaf pans:

-   30 minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to middle position and
    heat oven to 190°C (375°F).
-   Bake until loaves register 95°C (200°F), 30-35 minutes.
-   Transfer pans to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes.

#### Boule

If baking as a boule:

-   30 minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to middle position.
-   Oil a baking stone with olive oil and place it on the middle rack.
-   Heat oven to 190°C (375°F).
-   Drop the dough onto the baking stone
-   Bake until loaves register 95°C (200°F), 35-45 minutes.

### Cool

**120 minutes**

-   Remove loaves from pans (or remove boule from oven)
-   Return loafs to rack
-   Let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, before slicing and
    serving.

## Storage

### Day to Day Storage

-   Unsliced bread can be stored in the open for about 4 to 5 days.
-   Wrap sliced bread fully in parchment paper.

### Freezing

-   Bread can be wrapped in freezer paper or parchment, then sealed with
    plastic wrap.
-   To re-heat/thaw:
    -   Heat an oven to 400°F.
    -   Remove bread from freezer and unwrap.
    -   Place bread in oven and let warm for five minutes.
    -   Turn off oven, and open door slightly ajar.
    -   Leave bread in oven until cool enough to handle.

## Notes

-   For those without a stand mixer: Stir wet and dry ingredients
    together with a stiff rubber spatula until the dough comes together
    and looks shaggy. Transfer the dough to a clean counter and knead by
    hand to form a smooth, rough ball, 15-25 minutes, adding additional
    flour, if necessary, to prevent the dough from sticking to the
    counter. Proceed with recipe as directed.
-   So far, **Saf Instant Yeast** yields the best results
