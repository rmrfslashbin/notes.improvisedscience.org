The go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Browning (rather than simply melting) the butter adds an extra dimension and is completely optional.

## Special Equipment

-   Stand mixer
-   Two cookie sheets (one will suffice)
-   Parchment paper

## Add-In's

-   ½ tart dried cherries (reduce chocolate chips a bit...)

## Pre-heat Oven

-   Preheat oven to 325℉
-   Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position
-   Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper

## Ingredients

- 270 grams (2 ¼ cups) All-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 170 grams (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted (or browned) and cooled
- 128 grams (¾ cup packed) light brown sugar
- 100 grams (½ cup) granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons honey or golden syrup
- 1 large egg plus 1 large yolk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 170 grams (1 cups) semisweet chocolate chips

## Preparation

### Combine dry ingredients

Combine and set aside:

- Flour
- Baking soda
- Cornstarch
- Salt

### Cream butter & sugar

Using stand mixer with paddle, cream together until smooth (about 2 minutes)

- Melted/browned butter
- Brown sugar
- Granulated sugar
- Honey or golden syrup

Add egg and Yolk; add vanilla, beat until combined.

### Combine wet and dry

-   Reduce stand mixer speed to low and add flour mixture in 3 additions until just combined, scraping down bowl as needed. 
-   Stir in chocolate chips by hand.

## Bake

-   Working with 2 tablespoons dough at a time, roll into balls and space them 2 inches apart on prepared sheets. 
-   Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are set and beginning to brown but centers are still soft and puffy, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. 
-   Let cookies cool on sheets for 10 minutes before serving.

## Notes

- If you have only one cookie sheet, let the cookie sheet cool to room temperature before placing dough on fresh parchment. Placing the dough on a hot sheet will skew the cooking time.
- To brown the butter, place the butter in a small skillet. Heat over med/low heat- you'll hear "crackles" as the butter browns. Once the crackles stop, the butter is browned. Little to no stiring is required- just give the skillet a shake now and then to encourage even melting.
