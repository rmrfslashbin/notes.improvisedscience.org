Family recipe from sister, Rachael.

## Equipment
- 6-quart slow cooker (Crock Pot)
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Fine-mesh strainer

## Ingredients

### For 1 Cup Dried Beans (serves 4)
- 1 cup (200g) dried Anasazi beans
- 1 teaspoon (6g) fine sea salt
- 1 teaspoon (5g) baking soda
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil
- 3 cups (720ml) water

## Instructions

### Preparation (10 minutes)
1. **Sort the beans**: Spread beans on a light-colored surface and pick through them carefully, removing any rocks, debris, or damaged beans.

2. **Rinse thoroughly**: Place beans in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until the water runs clear.

3. **Combine ingredients**: Transfer rinsed beans to the slow cooker. Add salt, baking soda, olive oil, and water. Stir well to distribute the baking soda and salt evenly throughout the liquid.

### Cooking (8 hours)
4. **Slow cook**: Cover the slow cooker and set to LOW. Cook for 8 hours until beans are tender and creamy. The beans should be soft enough to mash easily with a fork but still hold their shape.

5. **Check and adjust**: After cooking, taste and adjust salt if needed. If the beans are too thick, add warm water a few tablespoons at a time until you reach your desired consistency.

## Scaling Notes

**IMPORTANT**: Salt and baking soda do not scale linearly when increasing batch sizes.

### For 2 Cups Beans (2x recipe):
- 2 cups (400g) dried beans
- **1.75 to 2 teaspoons salt** (reduce by 10-15%)
- **1.75 to 2 teaspoons baking soda** (reduce by 10-15%)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 6 cups water

### For 3 Cups Beans (3x recipe):
- 3 cups (600g) dried beans
- **2 to 2.5 teaspoons salt** (reduce by 15-30%)
- **2 to 2.5 teaspoons baking soda** (reduce by 15-30%)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 9 cups water

**Why reduce?** In larger batches, salt distributes more efficiently through greater liquid volume, and excessive baking soda can make beans mushy with an unpleasant soapy taste. Start with the lower amount and adjust salt to taste after cooking.

## Notes

- **No soaking required**: The baking soda helps soften the beans without overnight soaking.
- **Baking soda purpose**: Creates an alkaline environment that breaks down the beans' cell walls, reducing cooking time and creating a creamier texture.
- **Don't skip the sorting**: Dried beans often contain small rocks that can damage teeth or your slow cooker.
- **Salt timing**: Adding salt at the beginning is fine for slow-cooked beans. The long, gentle cooking doesn't toughen them.
- **Texture preference**: For firmer beans, reduce cooking time by 1-2 hours. For very creamy beans that break down more, cook for 9-10 hours.
- **Altitude adjustment**: At high altitudes, you may need to add 1-2 hours to the cooking time.

## Variations

- **Southwestern style**: Add 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon chili powder, and 2 minced garlic cloves with the other ingredients.
- **Herbed beans**: Add a bay leaf, fresh thyme sprigs, and a halved onion to the pot before cooking. Remove aromatics before serving.
- **Smoky beans**: Add 1 teaspoon smoked paprika or a few drops of liquid smoke.

## Storage

Store cooled beans in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Freeze in portion-sized containers for up to 3 months. The texture remains excellent after freezing. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding water as needed to restore desired consistency.
