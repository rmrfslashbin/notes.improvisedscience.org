A very simple Thanksgiving dressing (stuffing).

## Ingredients

-   1 large loaf good, crusty bread, preferably sourdough, ciabatta, or
    multi-grain (about 1¼ pounds)
-   ¼ cup olive oil
-   8 tablespoons cultured, unsalted butter- divided in two parts
-   6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
-   2 large leeks, white and light green parts, chopped
-   ½ cup dry white wine
-   ¼ cup finely chopped fresh sage
-   2 ½ cups low-sodium chicken, turkey or vegetable broth
-   5 large eggs
-   ½ cup finely chopped parsley
-   ¼ cup finely chopped chives

## Preheat Oven

-   Preheat oven to 375°F.

## Preparation

### Bread

-   Using your hands, tear bread, crust and all, into 1 ½- to 2-inch
    pieces.
-   Place chunks on a rimmed baking sheet, and let sit uncovered at room
    temperature for 12 to 24 hours. If you’re short on time, you can
    toast the chunks in a 300-degree oven instead, tossing occasionally,
    until lightly crisped, but not browned, on the outside.

### Leeks

-   Heat oven to 375°F.
-   In a large skillet over medium-high heat, combine olive oil and 4
    tablespoons butter.
-   Once butter has melted, add the garlic and leeks.
-   Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until
    leeks are bright green and totally softened, 8 to 10 minutes.
-   Add sage and cook an additional 4 to 6 minutes.
-   Add white wine, and cook until reduced by about three-quarters, 3 to
    4 minutes.
-   Remove from heat.

### Broth

-   In a medium bowl, whisk together broth and eggs.
-   Into a large bowl, combine until evenly distributed:
    -   Bread
    -   The leek mixture
    -   Parsley
    -   Chives

### Combine

-   Pour about half the egg mixture over the bread and toss a few times.
-   Let sit a minute or two and give another toss.
-   Let sit about 20 minutes.
-   Add more egg mixture until mixture is very wet.

### Bake

-   Transfer mixture to a 2 1/2- to 3-quart baking dish (a 9-by-13 pan
    also works), making sure not to pack it too tightly.
-   Cover with foil and bake until the stuffing is sizzling at the edges
    and completely cooked through, about 25 to 30 minutes.
-   If it’s not yet time to serve, remove stuffing from the oven and set
    aside. (If you are nearly ready to serve, proceed directly to the
    next step and continue without pausing.)

### Finish

-   When ready to serve, remove foil and increase the temperature to
    425°F.
-   Dot the top with remaining butter.
-   Bake stuffing until crispy, crunchy and golden brown on top, 20 to
    25 minutes.
-   Serve.
