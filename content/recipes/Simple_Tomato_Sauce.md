## Equipment

-   Medium Dutch oven
-   Large bowl
-   Hand/immersion blender, blender, food processor, or food mill

## Ingredients

-   6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   5 cups diced yellow onions, red onions or shallots
-   Fine sea salt
-   1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled, diced, crushed or puréed tomatoes
-   4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
-   2 tablespoons tomato paste
-   4 to 5 basil stems
-   ¼ teaspoon red-pepper flakes

## Preparation

### Cook Onions

-   Set a medium Dutch oven or similar pot over **medium heat**, and add
    **4 tablespoons olive oil**.
-   When the oil shimmers, add **onions** and a **pinch of salt**.
-   Reduce heat to **medium-low** and cook, stirring regularly, until
    onions are lightly golden and tender, **16 to 18 minutes.**

### While the Onions Cook

-   In the meantime, pour the **tomatoes** into a large bowl and use
    hands to crush, if using whole tomatoes.
-   Pour about **1 1/2 cups water** into the can and swirl to rinse any
    remaining purée off the sides.
-   Add the water to the tomatoes in the bowl and set aside.

### Add Garlic & Tomatoes

-   Once onions are soft and golden, add **garlic** and cook, stirring
    until it threatens to turn golden, about **90 seconds**.
-   Add **tomato paste** and cook until color deepens, about **3
    minutes**.
-   Add **tomatoes** and season with **salt**.
-   Add **basil stems** and **red-pepper flakes**.

### Simmer

-   Stirring regularly, allow sauce to come to a boil, then reduce heat
    to **low**, **cover and simmer** until sauce tastes savory and all
    raw tomato flavor is gone, about **45 minutes**.

### Finish

-   Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and add remaining 2 tablespoons
    **oil**.
-   Use a hand blender to purée, pass through a food mill or let cool,
    then purée using a blender or food processor.
-   Tomato sauce can be made 1 day in advance and refrigerated or frozen
    up to 3 months.
