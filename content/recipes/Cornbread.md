### Brown Butter

-   On the stovetop, in an 11- or 12-inch cast iron skillet, melt the

-   Pour brown butter into a large bowl. (Do not wipe out the pan.)

### Wet Ingredients

-   If using, whisk the **maple syrup** into the butter.
-   Whisk **buttermilk** into the butter.
-   The mixture should be cool to the touch; if not, let cool.
-   Whisk in the **eggs**.

### Combine with Dry Ingredients

Into the butter/buttermilk mixture, whisk in:

-   Cornmeal
-   Flours
-   Baking powder
-   Salt
-   Baking soda

### Bake

-   If the skillet is no longer hot, reheat it briefly on the stove for
    a few minutes.
-   Scrape batter back into the skillet.
-   Bake until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into it
    emerges clean, **30 to 40 minutes**.
-   Cool in the skillet for **10 minutes** before slicing.
