## Notes

-   Parsnips wider than 1 inch may have tough, fibrous cores that are
    best trimmed and discarded.
-   Using warm water helps the sugar to dissolve more readily.
-   Any combination of carrots and parsnips with a combined weight of 3
    pounds can be used in this recipe.

## Ingredients

-   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
-   1 ½ pounds carrots, peeled and cut diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick
    pieces
-   1 ½ pounds parsnips, peeled and cut diagonally into 1/2-inch pieces
-   ¾ cup apple cider
-   1 tablespoons maple syrup
-   Salt and pepper
-   ½ teaspoon minced fresh rosemary

## Preparation

1.  Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.
2.  Cook carrots and parsnips, stirring occasionally, until golden
    brown, 12 to 14 minutes.
3.  Whisk apple cider, maple syrup, and 1 teaspoon salt in small bowl.
4.  Add water mixture to skillet and cook covered, stirring
    occasionally, over medium-low heat until vegetables are tender and
