## Equipment

-   9x11" glass baking dish

## Preheat Oven

Preheat over to 350Â°F.

## Ingredients

-   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-   1 pound bunch spinach, washed and stemmed, or 1/2 pound bagged baby spinach
-   3 cups [simple tomato sauce]({{< ref "/recipes/simple_tomato_sauce" >}})
-   227 grams (8 ounces) ricotta cheese
-   1 egg
-   Pinch of cinnamon
-   9 to 11 lasagna noodles
-   113 grams (4 ounces / 1 cup) freshly grated Parmesan; more as needed.

## Optionals

-   2 medium zucchini, cut in half crosswise, then cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices
-   1.5 lbs mushrooms
-   2 to 3 Bell peppers

## Preparation

### Roast Vegetables

Roast vegetables in the oven as need. Mushrooms are better sauteed with some water.

### Sautee Spinach

-   In a large pot, add spinach leave and a bit of water.
-   Cook over medium-high heat until leaves are wilted.
-   Using a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth, press/squeeze as much water out of the spinach as possible.
-   Set aside to cool.
-   Chop when ready to use.

### Lasagna Noodles

Cook noodle sheets per directions. 9 are required for the dish; the extras are in case of rips or breaks.

### Ricotta Cheese

In a small bowl, combine:
-   Ricotta cheese
-   Egg
-   Cinnamon
-   Salt/Pepper to taste

### Build

Using a lightly oiled 9x13" baking dish, spread a spoonful of sauce over the bottom of the dish, then layer two-times:

-   Noodles (three per layer)
-   Ricotta mixture
-   Vegetables (spinach, mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, etc)
-   Sauce
-   Parmesan cheese

Finish with a top layer of noodles topped with more sauce and parmesan cheese.

## Bake

-   Oil a sheet of foil with cooking spray to avoid sticking.
-   Tightly cover the baking dish with foil.
-   Bake for 40 minutes.
-   Uncover and bake another 10 minutes.

## Rest

Remove from oven and let rest, uncovered, for 5 to 10 minutes and serve.
