Using one sugar/pie pumpkin, split in half and remove seeds. Briefly
wash seeds in cool water, removing any strings and pulp which may still
be attached. If roasting a sugar pumpkin, place the seeds in a bowl,
cover with water, and add a tablespoon of salt. Let the seeds sit while
the pumpkin is roasting. Once the pumpkin has roasted, use your fingers
to remove any additional pulp or strings which may still be present.

## Instructions

### Preheat Oven

-   Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
-   Adjust rack to top position.

### Measure

-   Measure the pumpkin seeds in a one cup measuring cup.
-   Place the seeds in a medium saucepan.
-   For every half-cup of seeds, add 2 cups of water and 8 grams (1
    tablespoon) of salt to the pan.
-   Add more salt if you would like your seeds to be saltier.

### Boil

-   Bring the salted water and pumpkin seeds to a boil.
-   Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
-   Remove from heat and drain.

### Roast

-   Coat the bottom of a roasting pan or baking sheet with olive oil.
-   Spread the seeds over the roasting pan in a single layer, and toss
    them a bit to coat them with the oil.
-   Roast until the seeds begin to brown, 5-20 minutes, depending on the
    size of the seeds.
-   Keep a close eye on the seeds as they can go from golden to burnt in
    less than a minute.
