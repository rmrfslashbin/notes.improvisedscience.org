I finally decided to try making a pumpkin pie using a real live pumpkin
as opposed to canned pumpkin. I picked up a nice sized pie pumpkin at
the [Dekalb Farmer's Market](http://www.dekalbfarmersmarket.com/), found
a recipe, and set out to make the pie. It was simple, easy, and required
very little effort. All redundant statements- just to underscore how
crazy easy it us to use a fresh pumpkin. I'll never buy a can of pumpkin
puree again!

Due to the variability of the pumpkin pulp, sometimes you end up with a
lot more filling than anticipated. As opposed to using a traditional 9"
pie pan, I usually opt for a 9" round cake pan with high sides- this
allows room for the variability. However, if you do go with the more
traditional pie pan... I've poured the extra product into crème brûlée
ramekins: set in a water bath and bake at 350°F till set.

## Recipe Source

I picked this recipe mostly because I had the ingredients on-hand. Of
the most exotic were evaporated milk.

## Special Equipment

-   9" pie pan --OR--
-   9" round cake pan with high sides

## Ingredients

-   510 grams (2 cups) of pumpkin pulp purée from a sugar pumpkin
-   1 12 oz. can of evaporated milk
-   130 grams (½ cup) packed dark brown sugar
-   75 grams (1/3 cup) white sugar

-   2 teaspoons of cinnamon
-   1 teaspoon ground ginger
-   ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
-   ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
-   ¼ teaspoon ground cardamon

## Preparation

-   1 recipe [Pâte Brisée]({{< ref "/recipes/pate_brisee" >}}), [Graham Cracker
    Crust]({{< ref "/recipes/graham_cracker_crust" >}}) or other suitable crust.

### Preheat Oven

If blind baking a pie crust, heat oven as directed, prepare crust, and
then...

-   Preheat oven to 425°F

### Roast Pumpkin

-   With a small-medium sugar pumpkin, cut out the stem and scrape out
    the insides, discard (save the seeds for roasting later).
-   Cut the pumpkin in half and lay cut side down on a rimmed baking
    sheet lined with silpat or aluminum foil.
-   Fill with ¼" water.
-   Bake at 350°F until fork tender, about an hour to an hour and a
    half.
-   Remove from oven, let cool.
-   Peel skin and/or scoop out pulp with spoon.
-   If you want the pulp to be extra smooth, put it through a food mill
    or chinois.
-   I've also had good outcome by microwaving the pumpkin puree for 10
    to 15 minutes to evaporate excess water.
-   Adjust oven temperature to 425°

    out clean.
