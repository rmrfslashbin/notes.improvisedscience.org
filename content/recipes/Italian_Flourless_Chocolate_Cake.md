-   8" round cake pan

## Ingredients

-   100 grams (7 tablespoons) unsalted butter softened, plus more for
    pan
-   60 grams (½ cup)confectioners’ sugar, sifted, plus more for dusting
-   113 grams (4 ounces) 70% “top quality” dark chocolate
-   2 extra-large eggs, separated

-   40 grams (3 ½ tablespoons) extra or superfine sugar

 ## Preparation

-   Heat oven to **350° F**.
-   Butter an **8-inch cake pan**. Line bottom with parchment.
-   In a **large bowl**, using a mixer or by hand, beat the **butter**
    with the **confectioners’ sugar** until smooth and creamy.
-   Melt **chocolate** in a pan on top of stove.
-   Pour warm chocolate over the butter and sugar mixture and beat until
    smooth.
-   Whisk in **egg yolks** one at a time.
-   Stir in **starch**.
-   Using a stand mixer, beat **egg whites** until soft peaks form.
-   Gradually beat in **superfine sugar** and continue beating until
    firm peaks develop.
-   Fold egg whites into chocolate mixture.
-   Scrape the batter out of the bowl, and spread it in the pan.
-   Bake for **18 minutes**.
-   Cake will rise and top will look dry and a little crackly.
-   Remove pan from oven, place on a rack and allow to cool completely,
    about **2 hours**. Cake will sink a bit.
-   Unmold cake, peel off parchment, then invert onto a serving dish so
    the crackly surface is on top.
-   Generously sift **confectioners’ sugar** over the top, then serve.
