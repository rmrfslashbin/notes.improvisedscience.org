Whole cauliflower gets the pot-roast treatment in this Italian-inspired dish, braising in a spicy tomato sauce enriched with garlic and green olives. The cauliflower emerges fork-tender and infused with flavor, topped with golden-brown pecorino Romano that creates an irresistible crust.

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
- 6 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 3/4 to 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- Kosher salt and ground black pepper
- 120ml (1/2 cup) dry white wine
- 1 can (794g/28 ounces) whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand
- 120ml (1/2 cup) pitted green olives, roughly chopped
- 1 head cauliflower (900g-1.1kg/2 to 2 1/2 pounds), trimmed
- 60g (2 ounces) pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated (about 240ml/1 cup), plus more for serving
- 60ml (1/4 cup) fresh basil leaves, lightly packed and roughly chopped

### Optional Accompaniments
- Creamy polenta
- Crusty bread for serving
- Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling

## Equipment

- Dutch oven with lid (5-6 quart capacity)
- Sharp knife for trimming
- Skewer for testing doneness
- Wide metal spatula
- Large spoon or tongs

## Instructions

### Preparation

- **Position oven rack**: Adjust rack to lower-middle position.
- **Preheat oven**: Heat to 425°F (220°C).
- **Trim cauliflower**: Remove any leaves and trim the base flat, keeping the head intact.

### Making the Braising Liquid

- **Bloom aromatics**: In a Dutch oven over medium heat, combine oil, garlic, pepper flakes, oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is lightly browned, 2-3 minutes.
- **Add wine**: Pour in white wine and simmer until reduced to approximately 2 tablespoons, 5-6 minutes.
- **Build sauce**: Stir in crushed tomatoes with their juices, olives, 120ml (1/2 cup) water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then remove from heat.

### Braising Process

1. **Stage 1 - Initial braising (50-55 minutes)**: Place cauliflower stem-end down in the pot. Spoon some sauce over the top to coat. Cover with lid, transfer to oven, and cook until a skewer inserted straight down into the center meets just slight resistance, 50-55 minutes.

2. **Stage 2 - Cheese crust formation (15-20 minutes)**: Remove pot from oven (leave oven on). Uncover and sprinkle pecorino Romano evenly over cauliflower surface. Return to oven uncovered and cook until surface is deeply browned, 15-20 minutes.

3. **Stage 3 - Resting**: Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

### Serving

- **For whole presentation**: Using a wide metal spatula and large spoon or tongs, carefully lift cauliflower from pot and transfer to serving platter. Spoon sauce around the base.
- **For wedge presentation**: Transfer cauliflower to cutting board and cut into 4-6 wedges. Spoon sauce onto platter and arrange wedges on top.
- **Final touches**: Taste sauce and adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper. Sprinkle with fresh basil and additional pecorino. Drizzle with olive oil.

## Notes

- **Cauliflower prep**: Trimming the base flat is crucial for stability during cooking. Keep the core intact to maintain structure.
- **Testing doneness**: Always test at the center through the core - it's the densest part and takes longest to cook
- **Garlic browning**: Watch carefully to achieve light golden color without burning
- **Wine reduction**: Proper reduction concentrates flavor and cooks off alcohol
- **Sauce consistency**: The braising liquid reduces and concentrates during cooking, becoming a rich sauce
- **Cheese timing**: Adding pecorino for the final uncovered cooking creates a beautiful golden crust

## Variations

- **Milder version**: Reduce red pepper flakes to 1/4 teaspoon for less heat
- **Olive alternatives**: Substitute Kalamata olives for a different flavor profile, or capers for more brininess
- **Cheese options**: Use Parmigiano-Reggiano instead of pecorino for a milder, nuttier flavor
- **Herb variations**: Fresh oregano (1 tablespoon) can replace dried; try rosemary or thyme
- **Vegan adaptation**: Omit cheese or use nutritional yeast; the dish is still delicious

## Storage

Best served immediately while hot. Leftovers can be stored covered in refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in a covered pot with a splash of water or broth to prevent drying. The flavors often improve overnight.
